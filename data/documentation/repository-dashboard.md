title: CORE Repository Dashboard documentation
---

In an effort to improve the quality and transparency of the harvesting process
of the open access content and create a two way collaboration between the CORE
project and the providers of this content, CORE is introducing the
Repositories Dashboard.

**[Access the dashboard now](/dashboard).**

To register, please [send us an
email](mailto:d%61shb%6Far%64%40c%6Fre.ac%2Euk).

The aim of the Dashboard is to provide an online interface for repository
providers and offer, through this online interface, valuable information to
content providers about:

* The content harvested from the repository enabling its management, such as
* by requesting metadata updates or managing take-down requests. The times and
* frequency of content harvesting, including all detected technical issues and
* suggestions for improving the efficiency of harvesting and the quality of
* metadata, including compliance with existing metadata guidelines. Statistics
* regarding the repository content, such as the distribution of content
* according to subject fields and types of research outputs, and the
* comparison of these with the national average.

Existing users can invite other users to use the CORE dashboard, [see our
simple guide.](/help/inviteusers.pdf)
