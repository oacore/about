CORE Discovery is a new service assists users in finding freely accessible 
copies of research papers that behind a paywall. CORE Discovery currently 
provides access to millions of full text open access papers from within 
CORE and other data providers.

CORE Discovery processes and validates information from a number of large third 
party scholarly data sources to build and maintain a database of links pointing 
to freely available copies. The service also relies on information harvested by 
CORE from thousands of repositories and journals, meaning that CORE discovery 
maximises the coverage and accuracy of the Discovery service.

CORE Discovery has a preference in displaying first the open access content 
originating from our approved content providers and seeks alternative routes 
only when a free version is not available from them.
