Beta notice: while in beta, we cannot guarantee completeness or integrity of the dataset and we appreciate any feedback on the format or data of the dataset. We are aware of an issue where the statistics in the repository object are incorrect or incomplete. We do not use these fields internally and plan on removing them in future releases.

## Structure of datasets

### 2018 onwards

The downloadable tar file contains XZ compressed files of Article Metadata. The XZ compressed file is a file named \[repositoryID\].json.xz. Once decompressed, each line in the text file contains the metadata for 1 article in JSON.

We chose the xz format due to a better compression ratio vs bzip2 or gzip. The downside is the tools are not always installed by default.  
Most Linux distributions have xz available for installation in the default package manager. Mac users can install xz via Brew or MacPorts and there are many other free alternatives. Windows users can use 7-zip. If you have any trouble extracting the files, please contact us.

Please note that each JSON file is _not_ valid JSON however, each line is. Each line is delimited using a Windows formatted newline (\\r\\n).

  
The dump structure has changed to following format:

```json
{
  "doi": str|None,
  "coreId": str|None,
  "oai": str|None
  "identifiers": [str],
  "title": str|None,
  "authors": [str],
  "enrichments": {
    "references": [str],
    "documentType": {
       "type": str|None,
       "confidence": str|None
    }
  },
  "contributors": [str],
  "datePublished": str|None,
  "abstract": str|None,
  "downloadUrl": str|None,
  "fullTextIdentifier": str|None,
  "pdfHashValue": str|None,

  "language": str|None,
  "relations": [str],
  "year": int|None,
  "topics": [str],
  "subjects": [str],
  "fullText": str|None
}
```

### 2017

An example of a metadata item in the data set is as follows. The full record will have more fields available and all fields in its entirety. New lines and truncated values are only for this example.

```json
{
  "id": "28929927",
  "authors": [
    "Knoth, Petr",
    "Anastasiou, Lucas",
    "Pearce, Samuel"
  ],
  "datePublished": "2014",
  "deleted": "ALLOWED",
  "description": "Usage statistics are frequently used by repositories [Description field truncated for example]",
    "fullText": "Open Research Online\nThe Open Universityâ€™s repository of research publications\nand other research outputs\nMy repository is being aggregated: a blessing or a\ncurse?\nConference Item\nHow to [full text field truncated for example]"
  "fullTextIdentifier": "http://oro.open.ac.uk/41678/1/OpenRepositories2014_v2.pdf",
  "identifiers": [
    "oai:oro.open.ac.uk:41678",
    null
  ],
  "rawRecordXml": "

  ...
}
``` 
                    

                    

### Pre-2017          

The CORE dataset provides access to both the enriched metadata as well as the full-texts. The data dump consists of two files, the metadata file and the content file. Both files are compressed using tar and gzip.

An example of a metadata item in the data set is as follows:

```json
{
  "identifier": 13291,
  "ep:Repository": 1,
  "dc:type": [
    "Report"
  ],
  "bibo:shortTitle": "Evaluating stillbirths : improving stillbirth data could help make stillbirths a visible public health priority",
  "bibo:AuthorList": [
    "IMMPACT",
    "Population Reference Bureau"
  ],
  "dc:date": "2007-02",
  "bibo:cites": [
    {
      "rawReferenceText": "Cynthia Stanton. Stillbirth Rates: Delivering Estimates",
      "authors": [

      ],
      "bibo:shortTitle": "Stillbirth Rates: Delivering Estimates",
      "doi": "10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68586-3"
    }
  ],
  "bibo:citedBy": [

  ],
  "similarities": [
    {
      "identifier": 29886,
      "sim:weight": 0.333121,
      "sim:AssociationMethod": "similarity_cosine"
    },
    {
      "identifier": 33044,
      "sim:weight": 0.325861,
      "sim:AssociationMethod": "similarity_cosine"
    },
    ...,
    {
      "identifier": 43755,
      "sim:weight": 0.173635,
      "sim:AssociationMethod": "similarity_cosine"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Disclaimer

This dataset has been created from information that was publicly available on 
the Internet. Every effort has been made to ensure this dataset contains 
open access content only. We have included content only from repositories 
and journals that are listed in registries where the condition for inclusion
is the provision of content under an open access compatible license. However, 
as metadata are often inconsistent, license information is often not machine 
readable and, from time to time, repositories leak information that is not 
open access, we cannot take any responsibility for the license of the 
content in the dataset. It is therefore up to the user of this dataset to 
ensure that the way in which they use the dataset does not breach copyright.
The dataset is in no way intended for the purposes of reading the original 
publications, but for machine processing only.
