  title: Disclaimer
  content: |
          The term (*)**CORE data** refers to a database created by harvesting and processing information publicly available on the Internet. Every effort has been made to ensure this dataset contains open access content only. We have included content only from repositories and journals that are listed in registries where the condition for inclusion is the provision of content under an open access compatible license. However, as metadata are often inconsistent, license information is often not machine readable and, from time to time, repositories leak information that is not open access, we cannot take any responsibility for the licences of the individual content in the dataset. It is therefore up to the user of this dataset to ensure that the way in which they use the dataset does not breach copyright of any third party. The dataset is in no way intended for the purposes of reading the original publications, but for machine processing only. <br>

          Additionally, while CORE retains no copyright in any of the works in the database, we reserve the sui generis database rights. This is due to the substantial investment in obtaining, processing and serving the aggregated data to the relevant communities of interest.
