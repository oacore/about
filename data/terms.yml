  - title: 3. Disclaimer
    id: disclaimer
    content: |
      The term (*)**CORE data** refers to a database created by indexing and processing information publicly available on the Internet. This database has been created for the purposes of machine processing, such as text and data mining, of scholarly information.

      Where this database contains original works, such as full texts of research papers, in a machine readable form, every effort has been made to ensure that these works have been made available as open access. In sourcing this information, we rely on information provided by scholarly article and repository registries as well as information from the sources themselves to identify open access content. In collecting and curating the database, we had lawful access to all materials which were publicly available without circumventing any technical measures, including access control mechanisms or instructions such as those expressed in robots.txt files. However, as metadata are often inconsistent, licence information is often not machine-readable and, from time to time, repositories leak information that is not open access, CORE does not accept any responsibility or liability for the use of the database. The database is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis.

      It is therefore up to the user to ensure that the way in which they use CORE data does not breach the rights of third parties. The dataset is in no way intended for the purposes of reading the original publications, but for machine processing only. By accessing or using CORE data, you agree to comply with all applicable laws and regulations in your jurisdiction, including but not limited to copyright law, data protection law, and other relevant legal requirements. You must not use the dataset for any unlawful purpose, including, without limitation, infringement of copyright, violation of privacy rights, harassment, defamation, or any activity prohibited by applicable legislation in the jurisdiction in which you access or use the dataset. The licence also does not authorise reproduction, distribution, or other uses of the underlying works beyond what is permitted by law.

       While CORE retains no copyright in any of the underlying works in the database, we reserve the sui generis database rights. Additionally unauthorised extraction, scraping, or acquisition of CORE data through channels not intended for its distribution constitutes a violation of CORE’s licence and is strictly prohibited. This is due to the substantial investment and costs in obtaining, processing, transforming and serving the data to the relevant communities of interest. Where CORE licenses CORE data, such licence applies only to the sui generis database rights and information created by CORE, such as CORE generated metadata, and does not convey or grant any rights in the underlying works contained within the database.
