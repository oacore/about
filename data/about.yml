  title: Our mission
  short: |
    CORE’s mission is to aggregate all open access research outputs
    from repositories and journals worldwide and make them available to
    the public. In this way CORE facilitates free unrestricted access
    to research for all.

      CORE:

      * supports the right of citizens and general public to access the results
        of research towards which they contributed by paying taxes,
      * facilitates access to open access content for all by offering services
        to general public, academic institutions, libraries, software
        developers, researchers, etc.,
      * provides support to both content consumers and content providers by
        working with digital libraries, institutional and subject
        repositories and journals,
      * enriches the research content using state-of-the-art technology and
        provides access to it through a set of services including search,
        API and analytical tools,
      * contributes to a cultural change by promoting open access, a fast
        growing movement.

      CORE harvests openly accessible content available according to the definition:

      > By 'open access' to this literature, we mean its free availability on the public internet, permitting any users to read,
      download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles, crawl them for indexing,
      pass them as data to software, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without financial, legal, or technical barriers other
      than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself. The only constraint on reproduction and distribution,
      and the only role for copyright in this domain, should be to give authors control over the integrity of their work and
      the right to be properly acknowledged and cited.

    title: Harvesting data
    content: |
      CORE aggregates ('harvests') research papers from data providers from all over the world including institutional and subject repositories, open access and hybrid journal publishers.

      This allows us to offer search, text mining and analytical capabilities over not only metadata, but also the full text (extracted from PDFs) of the research papers, making CORE a unique service in the research community.

      CORE currently contains 77,354,561 open access articles, from over 6000 journals, collected from over 2,536 repositories around the world.
  services:
    title: The services we offer
    content: |
      Our unique dataset allows us to offer a number of services for a range of audiences.

      Our  [CORE Repository Dashboard](http://www.google.com)   enables repository managers to improve the harvesting processes and aids in the management and quality of repository content.

      The  [Core Recommender](http://www.google.com)  is a plugin that uses our vast collection of data to enable users of search systems to discover content relevant to their needs.

      Our [CORE API and Datasets](http://www.google.com)  enable machine access to our collection, enabling exciting kinds of analysis, as well as services to be built that make use of the data, greatly widening the potential impact of open access research.

      ##### CORE vision and mission

      Knoth, P. and Zdrahal, Z. (2012) CORE: [Three Access Levels to Underpin Open Access](http://oro.open.ac.uk/35755/), *D-Lib Magazine*, 18, 11/12, Corporation for National Research Initiatives.

      *Sets the vision for creating the CORE service, developing global-wide content aggregation of all open access research literature (on top of OAI-PMH protocol for metadata harvesting and other protocols). It sets the mission to develop the three access levels (access at the granularity of papers; analytical access; access to raw data) via CORE.*


      ##### CORE Aggregation approaches and infrastructure

      Knoth, P. (2013). [From Open Access Metadata to Open Access Content: Two Principles for Increased Visibility of Open Access Content](http://oro.open.ac.uk/37824/). *Open Repositories 2013*, Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada.

      *This paper describes the two principles that should be followed to ensure that content can be properly harvested from repositories. This paper could be of great interest to repository managers.*

        *This paper presents the CORE Repositories Dashboard, a tool designed primarily for repository managers. It describes how the Dashboard improves the quality of the harvested papers, advances the collaboration between the repository managers and CORE, enables a straightforward management of their collections and enhances the transparency of the harvested content.*

      ##### CORE and Download Statistics
