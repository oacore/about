      CORE:

      * supports the right of citizens and general public to access the results
        of research towards which they contributed by paying taxes,
      * facilitates access to open access content for all by offering services
        to general public, academic institutions, libraries, software
        developers, researchers, etc.,
      * provides support to both content consumers and content providers by
        working with digital libraries, institutional and subject
        repositories and journals,
      * enriches the research content using state-of-the-art technology and
        provides access to it through a set of services including search,
        API and analytical tools,
      * contributes to a cultural change by promoting open access, a fast
        growing movement.

      CORE harvests openly accessible content available according to the
      definition:

      > By 'open access' to this literature, we mean its free availability on
      > the public internet, permitting any users to read, download, copy,
      > distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles,
      > crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them
      > for any other lawful purpose, without financial, legal, or technical
      > barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the
      > internet itself. The only constraint on reproduction and distribution,
      > and the only role for copyright in this domain, should be to give
      > authors control over the integrity of their work and the right to be
      > properly acknowledged and cited.
      >
      > *Part of the [BOAI declaration](http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org)*
