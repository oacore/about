      CORE:

      * supports the right of citizens and general public to access the results
        of research towards which they contributed by paying taxes,
      * facilitates access to open access content for all by offering services
        to general public, academic institutions, libraries, software
        developers, researchers, etc.,
      * provides support to both content consumers and content providers by
        working with digital libraries, institutional and subject
        repositories and journals,
      * enriches the research content using state-of-the-art technology and
        provides access to it through a set of services including search,
        API and analytical tools,
      * contributes to a cultural change by promoting open access, a fast
        growing movement.

      CORE harvests openly accessible content available according to the
      definition:

      > By 'open access' to this literature, we mean its free availability on
      > the public internet, permitting any users to read, download, copy,
      > distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles,
      > crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them
      > for any other lawful purpose, without financial, legal, or technical
      > barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the
      > internet itself. The only constraint on reproduction and distribution,
      > and the only role for copyright in this domain, should be to give
      > authors control over the integrity of their work and the right to be
      > properly acknowledged and cited.
      >

    title: Harvesting data
    content: |
      CORE aggregates ('harvests') research papers from data providers from all
      over the world including institutional and subject repositories, open
      access and hybrid journal publishers.

      This allows us to offer search, text mining and analytical capabilities
      over not only metadata, but also the full text - extracted from PDFs -
      of the research papers, making CORE a unique service in the research
      community.

      CORE currently contains {{totalArticlesCount}}&nbsp;open access articles,
      from over tons of thousands journals, collected from over
      {{repositoriesCount}}&nbsp;repositories around the world.

    title: The services we offer
    content: |
      Our unique dataset allows us to offer a number of services for a
      range of audiences.

      Our  [CORE Repository Dashboard](~services/repository-dashboard)
      enables repository managers to improve the harvesting processes
      and aids in the management and quality of repository content.

      The  [Core Recommender](~services/recommender)  is a plugin that uses
      our vast collection of data to enable users of search systems to discover
      content relevant to their needs.

      Our [CORE API and Datasets](~services/api)  enable machine access
      to our collection, enabling exciting kinds of analysis, as well
      as services to be built that make use of the data, greatly widening
      the potential impact of open access research.
