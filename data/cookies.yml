    title: Measuring website usage (Google Analytics)
    content: |
      We use Google Analytics to collect information about how people use our
      site, and rough demographics as to what groups of people are using our
      site. We do this to make sure it’s meeting your needs and to understand
      how we could improve it. You can [opt out of Google Analytics
      tracking](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).

      Google Analytics stores information about:

      * the pages you visit
      * how long you spend on each page
      * how you got to the site
      * what you click on while you're here
      * your broad demographic profile (age range, gender, interests)

      Google Analytics does not have access to the personal information you
      provide us (eg your name) so it doesn’t know who you are.
