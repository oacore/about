  title: Initial idea developed
  body: Petr Knoth comes up with the idea of aggregating research papers as part of his doctoral work at the Knowledge media institute, The Open University. He recognises that research papers are scattered across many systems limiting their reuse potential. He is motivated by the opportunity to connect repositories by aggregating open access papers so that research papers can be text-mined, enabling the development of innovative technologies for information access. He becomes a strong supporter of the open access movement and open access repositories, wanting to see democratisation of knowledge generated using tax-payers’ money.

  title: Initial grant application submitted
  body: Petr Knoth writes an application for the first grant for his idea. He is asking for an initial seed of £40k which will fund his project for 6 months. The CORE (COnnecting REpositories) brand is born.

  title: CORE project started
  body: "The first grant for CORE is awarded by Jisc in January and the project commences on 1st February 2011, initiating a long-term collaboration of the Open University and Jisc (which is not yet known at this time). CORE embarks on a mission to facilitate free, unrestricted access to research for all. \n\nCORE’s initial goal is to connect 20 repositories and provide a recommendation system for their papers. \n\nOne of the project’s achievements is the integration of the CORE Plugin (later called CORE Recommender) into the Open University’s repository, Open Research Online. This is the first adopter with hundreds more to follow in the future. \n\nThe project over-delivers, developing an aggregation engine for over 60 repositories, a recommender system, linked open data module and search and web UI. The funder (Jisc) is impressed, paving the way for new opportunities."

  title: From a national aggregator to a worldwide aggregator
  body: "Petr Knoth secures a new grant running for 9 month with the objective of developing a UK nationwide aggregation service for research publications scattered across institutional repositories. The potential of the system is demonstrated through the development of 5 services on top of the aggregation system: CORE Portal (with search), CORE Mobile, CORE Recommender and CORE API. \n\nThe project again over-delivers, resulting not just in the aggregation of the vast majority of the UK repositories but quickly expanding, both technically and strategically, to aggregated research outputs from institutional repositories aggregated globally."

  title: Another grant brings a 2 year stability
  body: "A new research grant called DiggiCORE provides a necessary degree of stability for the development of CORE and allows expanding and improving the technology. \n\nThis is the time when CORE manages to scale out its functionality to harvest, process and analyse not just metadata of open access research papers but their full texts too. This processing of full texts becomes a defining feature of CORE, connecting full text research papers from across repositories globally. It is a clear response to the need of going beyond poor quality metadata only silos on which it is hardly possible to develop engaging services."

  title: CORE becomes an open access service
  body: "A series of small grants and engagements eventually leads to the CORE team landing a multiyear national open access aggregator service contract with Jisc. CORE joins the Jisc Open Access Services portfolio, but the team delivering CORE stays at the Open University, in a bilateral agreement of Jisc with the Open University in which both institutions commit to supporting CORE. \n\nFrom a technical perspective, this enables CORE to develop its services along the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) paradigm and put in place the required hardware for the service provision."
