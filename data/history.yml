body: Since [our start](#2010-09-01-initial-idea "Scroll down to the genesis beginning") 10&nbsp;years ago, we collected {{totalArticlesCount}}&nbsp;scientific outputs along with&nbsp;{{fullTextCount}}&nbsp;hosted documents bringing open science to everyone. None of this was achieved in a moment, but we have worked hard over the last 10&nbsp;years. We are happy to share the story of us.
