  CORE aggregates research papers from data providers all over the world
  including institutional and subject repositories and journal publishers.
  This process, which is also called [harvesting](www.google.com), allows us to offer
  search, text mining and analytical capabilities over not only metadata, but also
  the full text of the research papers making CORE a unique service in the research
  community.

  from over tons of thousands journals, collected from over
