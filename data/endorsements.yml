  The CORE services have different applications and are aimed
  to a wide variety of stakeholders. Many enterprise companies use CORE
  to build search engines of research content, detect plagiarism
  and develop repository services.

    With millions of research papers available across thousands of different
    systems, CORE provides an invaluable service helping researchers to save
    time and effort. CORE’s mission to make all this content available for text
    and data mining is critical for future avenues of research, and a major
    part of advancing open science.

    The OpenAIRE infrastructure has recently started a collaboration with
    the CORE Team led by Petr Knoth in order to include in the OpenAIRE
    metadata and file aggregation chain the resources made available via
    the ResourceSync connector realised at the CORE Team Lab. To this aim,
    the OpenAIRE team is testing the CORE ResourceSync Connector code with
    the intention of integrating it in its production system before
    the end of 2017.

    CORE’s help has been invaluable as we have been tracking the transition
    to open access, and the growth in repositories and their contents.
    It is indeed a core resource for all those with any interest in open
    access and its development.

    Aggregation plays an increasingly essential role in maximising the
    long-term benefits of open access, helping to turn the promise of a
    'research commons' into a reality. The aggregation services that CORE
    provides therefore make a very valuable contribution to the evolving
    open access environment in the UK.

    As an Open Access advocate, CORE is an invaluable tool to demonstrate
    the potential of OA and when I show it to academic staff I can literally
    see the “penny drop” as they suddenly realise that potential for themselves.
    CORE also provides an opportunity to carry the discussion of OA beyond free
    to read to the immense potential of text mining, for example.

    One of the criticisms of repositories, particularly institutional
    repositories, has always been that while they are providing a great
    service they are doing so in a dispersed fashion across many repositories.
    CORE is providing a valuable service in support of repositories
    by aggregating the content repositories hold and curate individually
    and by providing additional end user services, such as the portal
    and mobile app, to an impressive collection of open access
    scholarly material.

    The CORE team understand data mining. As an independent company, we had
    no obvious access to big, diverse scholarly data – a killer in our drive
    to develop classification algorithms. The CORE repository, available
    in bulk, was a breakthrough. Now our algorithms outperform even those
    from huge publishers.

    We are integrating CORE API into our product, [IRIS](https://the.iris.ai),
    because so far it is the open access portal that covers almost all open
    access content, provides easy to integrate API and has a powerful search
    querying engine. We want to make open access articles more easily
    accessible and more useful to researchers and the open public and
    we see CORE API as a way to speed that up.

    By integrating with CORE, we have significantly increased the number of
    research papers in the Naver Academic indexes. In fact, CORE is Naver’s largest
    provider of full text content. CORE’s data are now synchronised with Naver
    using CORE FastSync, reducing the amount of effort that would be needed
    to collect these data in traditional ways.

     We use CORE API for our startup called [Rygbee](http://www.rygbee.com).
     It's an online "idea guide" that enables users to ideate and enrich their
     ideas by suggesting them with the relevant human and material resources.
     One such resource is research articles and one of the data source is CORE.

     Ritc is a platform on which real-time - or near real-time

     We have used mainly the Search API (http://core.ac.uk/api/search/⟨search_criteria⟩)
     to collect technical papers related to specific projects,
     using the project title and description to perform meaningful.searches.
     We are now using a complete export in JSON format (of several GBs)
     in order to import as many technical papers as possible to make theme
     available in our semantic search engine.
