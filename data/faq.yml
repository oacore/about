      - slug: is-my-repository-or-journal-harvested-by-CORE
        question: Is my repository or journal harvested by CORE?
        answer: |
          To check whether your repository or journal is harvested
          by CORE, go to our data providers [list](/data-providers).
      - slug: how-do-I-register-my-repository-or-journal-with-CORE?
        question: |
          How do I register my repository or journal with CORE?
        answer: |
          CORE uses information from various registries, such as
          [OpenDOAR](http://opendoar.org/) and [DOAJ](https://doaj.org/),
          to include new repositories and journals into CORE.
          If your repository or journal is already registered with
          some authoritative registry, you don't need to do anything.
          If your repository or journal has not been registered
          yet use [the form](~register-data-provider) to add it.
      - slug: where-are-the-repositories-harvested-by-CORE-located
        question: Where are the repositories harvested by CORE located?
        answer: |
          CORE is an international service and harvests repositories from
          various locations around the world. This information is displayed in
          a map at our [data providers page](/data-providers).
      - slug: I-would-like-to-include-them-in-CORE
        question: |
          I am an author of scientific papers and I would like to include
          them in CORE.
        answer: |
          CORE is a harvesting service and is not similar to research
          networking sites, e.g. ResearchGate or Academia.edu, where authors
          can deposit papers, so please do not email us the full text of your
          papers. If you have deposited your articles in a repository
          [let us know](~contact) the name of the repository.
          There are chances that we harvest it already and if we don’t we could
          start harvesting it.
      - slug: core-harvests-from-doaj
        question: |
          CORE harvests from DOAJ but I cannot find my journal which is already
          registered in DOAJ.
        answer: |
          CORE harvests DOAJ as a single entry, which means that each journal
          title does not appear separately in CORE. If you wish to have a
          separate entry for your journal in CORE, do [send us](~contact) the
          journal's OAI base URL and we will create a new entry.

        - slug: how-often-does-CORE-harvest-the-repositories
          question: |
            How often does CORE harvest the repositories?
          answer: |
            CORE does not harvest all the repositories that exist in our
            database with the same frequency. Repositories are harvested
            as frequently as our HW infrastructure allows.
            The specific time of harvesting for a repository is determined
            by the CORE Scheduler. The CORE Scheduler is a software component
            that ensures that our harvesting cluster of machines is close to
            fully utilised 24/7 for 365 days every year. As soon as some
            resource is freed, the CORE Scheduler decides which repository
            needs to be harvested based on several criteria. These criteria
            include, but are not limited to, the previous time of the repository
            being harvested, the size of the repository,
            the location of the repository, the repository's harvesting
            performance and information about potential previous harvesting
            errors. We review the functionality of the scheduler on a regular
            basis to ensure that its decisions on what to harvest next maximise
            the number of ingested documents over a unit of time.

            If you have a question regarding a specific
            repository do [get in touch](~contact) with us.
        - slug: when-will-the-harvesting-process-of-my-repository-be-completed
          question: |
            When will the harvesting process of my repository be completed?
          answer: |
            Depending on the size of the repository and the existing traffic
            in CORE's servers, the harvesting can last from a couple of hours
            to a couple of weeks. If we experience any technical issues
            during that period, we will get in touch.
        - slug: what-types-of-scientific-outputs-does-CORE-provide
          question: |
            What types of scientific outputs does CORE provide?
          answer: |
            CORE harvests all metadata records in a repository, but it is in
            position to harvest full text records in PDF only. We are working
            though to include other file types, such as HTML webpages, images etc.
        - slug: can-my-repository-be-harvested-by-CORE
          question: |
            My repository has plenty of metadata records, but not all of them
            have an open access full text. Can my repository be harvested by CORE?
          answer: |
            Yes it can, provided that the repository offers its content as
            [Open Access](~mission).
        - slug:  my-repository-contains-a-much-higher-number-of-records-than-CORE
          question: |
              My repository contains a much higher number of records than CORE.
              What can I do?
          answer: |
              Log in to the [CORE Repository Dashboard](~services/repository-dashboard)
              and look under the issues tab. Examine whether CORE has the correct oai base
              url of your repository or if there are any technical issues listed there.
              If there are no technical issues or you do not have an account for the CORE
              Repository Dashboard [contact us](~contact).
        - slug: can-I-upload-a-new-version
          question: |
            There is a mistake in my article, can I upload a new version?
          answer: |
            CORE works at the level of repositories and cannot update specific
            records. You can upload the new record into your institutional
            repository or journal and CORE will synchronise it at the next
            scheduled re-harvesting.
        - slug: there-are-many-new-records-in-my-repository
          question: |
            There are many new records in my repository. Do I need to notify CORE?
          answer: |
            No, CORE follows an automated re-harvesting process and your repository
            will be re-harvested at the next automated re-harvesting.
        - slug: core-vs-google-scholar
          question: |
            How is CORE different from Google Scholar?
          answer: |
            Google Scholar is a search engine containing scholarly research papers but
            it is not designed to aggregate repository and journal systems.
            More specifically:
            - Google Scholar crawls and indexes research papers that can be
              found on the web and links to the original source, while CORE
              harvests and caches the full text.
            - Google Scholar limits its access only at the
              [granularity level](http://www.dlib.org/dlib/november12/knoth/11knoth.html),
              i.e. its search engine, whereas CORE is in position to extend access
              to raw data and, apart from the CORE search engine.
            - Google Scholar offers both closed access and open access resources,
              while CORE offers open access resources only, enabling immediate
              access to full text.
            - The audience is different. Even though CORE has a search engine
              where users can retrieve scientific literature, it focuses also
              on other types of research stakeholders, such as text miners and repository
              managers, and offers services designed for them, such as the
              [CORE API](~services/api) and [Dataset](~services/dataset).
        - slug: there-is-no-download-button
          question: |
            I do not see the “Download” button in the CORE display page.
            How can I access the full text?
          answer: |
            CORE harvests content that is available open access elsewhere,
            i.e. repositories and open access journals. When the “Download”
            button is missing, it means that the full text is not available
            from the hosting service, CORE does not have it and displays only the metadata of
            this record. If you need to access the full text we recommend
            that you contact the content provider listed in the CORE
            metadata display page, at the section "Provided by".
        - slug: metadata-in-the-CORE-display-page-are-wrong
          question: |
            The metadata in the CORE display page are wrong. How can I have them corrected?
          answer: |
            CORE does not create the metadata, but rather harvests
            them from its content providers. If the metadata are wrong
            then contact the repository or journal where you had originally
            deposited or published your content.
        - slug: can-CORE-offer-any-statistics-about-the-content-it-harvests
          question: |
            Can CORE offer any statistics about the content it harvests?
          answer: |
            CORE can offer repository or journal full text download statistics per month via the
            [CORE Repository Dashboard](~services/repository-dashboard) but is not in position
            to offer single item downloads yet. If you do not have access to the
            Dashboard [contact us](~contact).
        - slug: are-the-research-papers-offered-by-CORE-peer-reviewed
          question: |
            Are the research papers offered by CORE peer-reviewed?
          answer: |
            Yes it does. CORE harvests content from repositories and journals. The first
            do not perform peer review of the deposited content but the latter
            do. In some occassions the content deposited in a repository is already
            published in a journal and is peer-reviewed. In addition, repositories may contain
            grey literature and these resources are not peer-reviewed.
        - slug: how-is-the-record-count-in-OpenDOAR-estimated-by-CORE
          question: |
            How is the record count in OpenDOAR estimated by CORE?
          answer: |
            CORE has created definitions with regards to the statistics it provided to OpenDOAR.

            **Metadata:** The total number of metadata records with a unique OAI identifier provided
            by the repository as this appears in the application profile which CORE harvest -
            if CORE harvests from the RIOXX endpoint, CORE will provide RIOXX counts instead of Dublin Core counts.

            **Full text:** Count of metadata records - as above - with a least one attachment
            provided by the repository being a pdf file, which a) is publicly downloadable
            (no-login required or output is not under embargo, etc.) and b) the full text is machine readable,
            i.e. it has an extractable text not via OCR.

        - slug: what-are-the-technical-requirements-for-being-aggregated
          question: |
            What are the technical requirements for being aggregated?
          answer: |
            In order to realise the data transfer and regular data updates of
            CORE and your system, CORE uses a variety of protocols to ingest
            the content. The easiest way to get your content integrated with CORE
            is the [OAI-PMH protocol](https://www.openarchives.org/pmh/).
            If you wish to join CORE get in [touch](~contact).
        - slug: what-is-my-journal-oai-base-url
          question: |
            What is my journal's oai base url?
          answer: |
            A journal's oai base url looks similar to this http://journaldomain.com/cgi/oai2
            or http://journaldomain.com/oai/request. A journal's webpage looks similar
            to this http://journaldomain.com and CORE
            cannot harvest the journal's content via its webpage url. If you
            are not sure whether your journal has an oai base url do contact
            the team that provides technical support to your journal.
        - slug: how-difficult-is-it-to-satisfy-the-CORE-harvesting-recommendations
          question: |
            How difficult is it to satisfy the CORE harvesting recommendations?
          answer: |
            We would expect that harvesting could take from one hour to a
            couple of days for a typical repository. In some repository
            systems, such as EPrints, most of these recommendations are
            followed by default. Find more details [how it
            works](~about#how-it-works).
        - slug: which-metadata-formats-does-CORE-support
          question: |
            Which metadata formats does CORE support?
          answer: |
            We mainly support oai\_dc, the mainstream metadata format used in the
            [OAI-PMH Protocol](http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html),
            utilising the [Dublin Core](http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/)
            vocabulary, a popular vocabulary for bibliographic data.
            We also support [RIOXX](http://rioxx.net/), a richer metadata
            protocol, used mostly by the UK repositories.
        - slug: can-CORE-just-index-our-content-but-not-store-it-on-its-servers
          question: |
            Can CORE just index our content, but not store it on its servers?
          answer: |
            To provide its service, it is essential for CORE to be able to store
            a cached copy of the harvested content. This is needed to verify open
            access sources, offer analytical services, support text and data mining,
            recommendation tools, etc. By cashing a copy of the harvested
            resource, CORE is not different from many commercial and
            non-commercial, academic and non-academic, search engines including
            Google or CiteSeerX.
            The primary difference from such systems is that CORE caches only
            copies of open access content. More information on the benefits of
            this approach is available in the “[CORE: Three Access Levels to
            Underpin Open Access](http://www.dlib.org/dlib/november12/knoth/11knoth.html)”
            article.
        - slug:  how-can-my-repository-opt-out-from-being-harvested-by-CORE
          question: |
            How can my repository opt out from being harvested by CORE?
          answer: |
            CORE uses information from various registries, such as
            [OpenDOAR](http://opendoar.org/), to include new repositories,
            journals and archives into CORE. If the circumstances have changed in
            your repository, you can restrict harvesting and crawling activities
            by modifying your rules in your “robots.txt” file by using the
            [Standard for Robots Exclusion](http://www.robotstxt.org/orig.html).
            This will also guarantee the content cannot be cached by search
            engines and harvesting systems. In addition, you could withdraw your
            repository from all open access registries lists; when this takes
            place, please [notify us](~contact).
    - id: removing-full-text-or-metadata
      title: Removing full text or metadata
      items:
        - slug: how-does-CORE-ensure-that-the-harvested-content-is-Open-Access
          question: |
            How does CORE ensure that the harvested content is Open Access?
          answer: |
            CORE aggregates content from repositories registered in
            [OpenDOAR](http://www.opendoar.org), journals registered
            in [DOAJ](http://www.doaj.org) or those content providers that
            requested their content to be aggregated. This means that all the
            content sources aggregated by CORE must be open access as this is a
            requirement for the providers to be included in these registries.
            According to the official [BOAI definition of open
            access](http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/openaccess/boai-10-recommendations),
            CORE is allowed to, _"distribute, search, or link to the full
            texts of articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data
            to software, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without
            financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those
            inseparable from gaining access to the Internet itself. The only
            constraint on reproduction and distribution, and the only role for
            copyright in this domain is to give authors control over the
            integrity of their work and the right to be properly acknowledged
            and cited."_
        - slug: CORE-harvests-copyrighted-material-from-my-repository
          question: |
            CORE harvests copyrighted material from my repository
          answer: |
            CORE’s system is fully automated and relies on data made available
            in a machine readable form. If your repository hosts full text with
            a restrictive license that prohibits harvesting, this needs to be
            properly communicated in a machine readable form. All non open
            access items should be blocked in the robots.txt file. If this
            information is provided in the metadata for each record and CORE
            exposes the full text, please get in [touch](~contact) with us.
        - slug: retrieve-license-information
          question: |
            How can I retrieve the license information (CC-BY, CC-BY-NC, etc.)
            from the harvested outputs?
          answer: |
            An output's license is not consistently exposed by content providers in a
            machine readable form. In some circumstances it may be possible to extract
            this from the "fulltextUrls" field in the [CORE API](~services/api). However, this is
            subject to the license the data offered by the data provider.
        - slug: full-text-record-is-deleted-from-my-repository
          question: |
            A full text record is deleted from my repository, but is still
            available in CORE
          answer: |
            CORE’s system is fully automated and relies on data made available
            in a machine readable form. Our system understands that the
            full text of a record was removed only when the record is marked
            as deleted in the metadata of your repository. See
            [how to take down full text](#how-do-I-notify-CORE-to-take-down-full-text-content)
            from CORE in the related FAQ.
        - slug: how-do-I-notify-CORE-to-take-down-full-text-content
          question: |
            How do I notify CORE to take down full text content?
          answer: |
            If full text content appears in CORE but not in the
            hosting service your repository manager can take it down via the
            [CORE Repository Dashboard](~services/repository-dashboard)
            anytime without notifying us. If the hosting service does not have
            access to the Dashboard visit [this page](~services/repository-dashboard).
        - slug: full-text-has-been-removed-but-metadata-still-visible
          question: |
            The full text has been removed, but the metadata is still visible
            in CORE
          answer: |
            It is a CORE policy to remove only the full text and not
            the metadata. Only in limited cases - e.g. when a publication
            did not happen - it is possible that the metadata can be removed.
            In that case,[email us](~contact).
        - slug: why-metadata-is-still-visible
          question: |
            I have removed an item from my repository, but the metadata are
            still visible in CORE
          answer: |
            In order for the metadata to be removed from CORE they need to be
            marked as "deleted/removed" in the repository. If the metadata are
            marked as "restricted" CORE will still display it.

        question: |
          Does CORE offer a higher download quota of the CORE API?
        answer: |
          Yes, this is possible but there is usually a cost associated with it.
          Please [email us](~contact) the name of your
          company or organisation, business entity, the number of requests you
          estimate to send and how often you will send them and we will get

        question: |
          Can I use the CORE API for commercial purposes?
        answer: |
          Yes, you can use the CORE API for commercial purposes, but you need
          to contact us first and let us know about it. Commercial use of our
          API could increase the traffic in our servers and we would like to be
          aware of the expected traffic.
      - slug: can-I-use-the-CORE-dataset-for-commercial-purposes
        question: |
          Can I use the CORE dataset for commercial purposes?
        answer: |
          Please note the dataset has been created from information that was
          publicly available on the Internet. Every effort has been made
          to ensure this dataset contains only open access content.
          We have included only content from repositories and journals that
          are listed in registries where the condition for inclusion is the
          provision of content under open access compatible license. However,
          as metadata are often inconsistent, licensed information is often not
          machine readable, and repositories from time to time leak information
          that is not open access, we cannot take any responsibility for the
          license of the content in the dataset. It is therefore up to the user
          of this dataset to ensure that the way in which they use the dataset
          does not breach copyright. The dataset is in no way intended for the
          purposes of reading the original publications, but for machine
          processing only.
      - slug: how-often-is-the-CORE-dataset-updated?
        question: |
          How often is the CORE dataset updated?
        answer: |
          We aim to generate a new public dataset at least once a year.
          If you need a more recent dataset, please [get in touch](~contact)
          with us as we might be able to arrange it.
      - slug: how-can-I-download-the-CORE-Recommender
        question: |
          How can I download the CORE Recommender?
        answer: |
          If you have access to the CORE Repositories Dashboard, log into the
          [CORE Repository Dashboard](~services/repository-dashboard) and you will get the
          instructions on how to download the
          [CORE Recommender](~services/recommender).
          Otherwise, visit our recommender
          [registration page](/recommender/register),
          where you will also find the installation instructions. Repository
          managers are highly recommended to use the CORE Repositories
          Dashboard.
      - slug: I-am-not-pleased-with-the-similar-papers
        question: |
          When I look at the papers I have authored, I am not pleased with the
          similar papers suggested by the CORE Recommender.
          How can I change that?
        answer: |
          The CORE recommender uses the popular [content-based filtering
          system](https://blog.core.ac.uk/2016/10/04/core-recommender/).
          The similar resources that appear in the CORE Recommender and their
          quality are highly impacted by the metadata information supplied by
          the repository of origin. If that information is incorrect or
          incomplete, you should contact the repository of origin. To improve
          the CORE recommendations, you can use the feedback button, with
          which you can remove any undesirable articles.
      - slug: Does-CORE-provide-a-list-of-PDFs-in-a-specific-language
        question: |
          Does CORE provide a list of PDFs in a specific language?
        answer: |
          Unfortunately CORE does not provide any language specific datasets
          at the moment. Users can use the CORE API to download individual
          PDFs.
      - slug: what-does-non-commercial-use-mean
        question: What does non-commercial use mean?
        answer: |
          Non-commercial means:
          - The organisation is a registered charity or a not-for-profit AND
          - the use of the CORE&nbsp;service will not enable, contribute to
            or support the use of any paid-for service of the organisation
            or of another third party organisation linked to this organisation.

      - slug: deposit-dates-be-provided-by-aggregators
        question: |
          Why should deposit dates be provided by aggregators and not by
          single institutions?
        answer: |
          Due to cross university collaborations some outputs that could be
          considered non-compliant due to a late deposit may be compliant
          due to a deposit that was made within the policy timeframe at
          another institution or subject repository. Individual institutions
          could benefit as they might not be fully aware of all compliant
          outputs and might consider some of their outputs non-compliant,
          while in fact they are compliant.
      - slug: how-do-I-ensure-that-my-repository-deposit-date-matches
        question: |
          How do I ensure that my repository's deposit date matches CORE’s
          deposit date?
        answer: |
          CORE captures data as explained in the [CORE
          recommendations](/ref-audit). By following our recommendations CORE
          should have the same deposit dates as the repository.
      - slug: metadata-record-with-a-full-text-PDF-does-not-appear-in-CORE
        question: |
          A metadata record with a full text PDF does not appear in CORE from my
          own repository but it has been harvested from another repository. What
          if the record was not deposited on time at the other repository. Will
          this have an impact with regards to the REF2021 compliance?
        answer: |
          CORE can identify deposits of the same articles from across
          repositories. By doing so, an output deposited late in repository A
          could be technically compliant provided that it was deposited within
          the timeframe at repository B, i.e. the earliest deposit date
          irrespective of the repository could be used. However, for the time
          being, CORE agreed to supply the data to Research England and it will
          be up the discretion of Research England to interpret the data. We
          understand that the motivation is to mark outputs as non-compliant
          only in cases where there is clear evidence that they are truly
          non-compliant.
      - slug: CORE-harvests-full-text-PDFs-only
        question: |
          CORE harvests full text PDFs only. Does this mean that outputs with
          full text in other formats, e.g. word documents or text files, will
          not be considered as REF2021 compliant outputs?
        answer: |
          CORE harvests both metadata and full texts, currently only in PDF
          format but we will include support for other formats in the future.
          While the presence of the full text is preferred, CORE has all
          information necessary to support the REF2021 audit as long as the
          metadata of your outputs are in CORE. To minimise the possibility of
          some of your outputs not being captured by CORE, please follow the
          [CORE recommendations](/ref-audit).
      - slug: when-I-log-into-the-CORE-Repository-Dashboard
        question: |
          When I log into the CORE Repository Dashboard in the “Content” tab I
          see a date. Is this date the deposit date that CORE has for the
          output?
        answer: |
          CORE captures data as explained in the [CORE
          recommendations](/ref-audit). By following our recommendations CORE
          should have the same deposit date as the repository. The date that you
          see in the in the [CORE Repositories
          Dashboard](~services/repository-dashboard) is the date the document
          was last seen in your repository and imported into CORE. We are
          currently considering the development of a further technical support
          to allow institutions to see the deposit dates CORE holds for their
          outputs.

        question: |
          How can I see the deposit date from my repository's REF-able outputs
          in CORE?
        answer: |
          The [CORE Repositories
          Dashboard](~services/repository-dashboard) does not currently provide information
          about the deposit date. While we would like to expose this information
          to HEIs, this is currently being discussed with RE and it is subject to
          resources being made available for development.
      - slug: can-I-have-my-repository-deposit-dates
        question: |
          Can I have my repository's deposit dates from CORE in a CSV file?
        answer: |
          We are currently discussing the level of support that CORE will be
          able to provide to repositories with Research England. We will provide
          more details about it as soon as we can.

          The date that a metadata record was created may not be the same with
          the date that the full text record was attached to a metadata record.
          How does CORE know the date that the full text was attached?
        answer: |
          CORE captures data as explained in the
          [CORE recommendations](/ref-audit).
      - slug: how-does-CORE-know-that-the-version-of-the-deposited-full-text
        question: |
          How does CORE know that the version of the deposited full text is the
          correct and compliant version?
        answer: |
          The validation that the deposited full text is the first compliant
          version is currently not in the scope of CORE's support for the
          REF2021 Audit. Research England might use other alternative methods to
          check this.
