      - slug: is-my-repository-or-journal-harvested-by-CORE
        question: Is my repository or journal harvested by CORE?
        answer: |
          To check whether your repository or journal is harvested
          by CORE, go to our data providers [list](path___core_repositories).
      - slug: how-do-I-register-my-repository-or-journal-with-CORE?
        question: |
          How do I register my repository or journal with CORE?
        answer: |
          CORE uses information from various registries, such as
          [OpenDOAR](http://opendoar.org/) and [DOAJ](https://doaj.org/),
          to include new repositories and journals into CORE.
          If your repository or journal is already registered with
          some authoritative registry, you don't need to do anything.
          If your repository or journal has not been registered
          yet get in [touch](~contact).
      - slug: where-are-the-repositories-harvested-by-CORE-located
        question: Where are the repositories harvested by CORE located?
        answer: |
          CORE is an international service and harvests repositories from
          various locations around the world. This information is displayed in
          a map and can be accessed [here](~providers).
      - slug: I-would-like-to-include-them-in-CORE
        question: |
          I am an author of scientific papers and I would like to include them in CORE.
        answer: |
          CORE is a harvesting service and is not similar to research networking sites,
          e.g. ResearchGate or Academia.edu, where authors can deposit papers,
          so please do not email us the full text of your papers. If you have deposited
          your articles in a repository [let us](~contact) know
          the name of the repository. There are chances that we it
          already and if we don't we could start harvesting it.

      - slug: how-often-does-CORE-harvest-the-repositories
        question: |
          How often does CORE harvest the repositories?
        answer: |
          CORE does not harvest all the repositories that exist in our database
          with the same frequency. If you have a question regarding a specific
          repository do get in [touch with us](~contact).
      - slug: when-will-the-harvesting-process-of-my-repository-be-completed
        question: |
          When will the harvesting process of my repository be completed?
        answer: |
          Depending on the size of the repository and the existing traffic
          in CORE's servers, the harvesting can last from a couple of hours
          to a couple of weeks. If we experience any technical issues
          during that period, we will get in touch.
      - slug: what-types-of-scientific-outputs-does-CORE-provide
        question: |
          What types of scientific outputs does CORE provide?
        answer: |
          CORE harvests all metadata records in a repository, but it is in
          position to harvest full text records in PDF only. We are working
          though to include other file types, such as HTML webpages, images etc.
      - slug: can-my-repository-be-harvested-by-CORE
        question: |
          My repository has plenty of metadata records, but not all of them
          have an open access full text. Can my repository be harvested by CORE?
        answer: |
          Yes it can, provided that the repository offers its content as
          [Open Access](path___core_about_main).
      - slug:  my-repository-contains-a-much-higher-number-of-records-than-CORE
        question: |
            My repository contains a much higher number of records than CORE.
            What can I do?
        answer: |
            Log in to the CORE Repository Dashboard (~services#dashboard)
            and look under the issues tab. Examine whether CORE has the correct oai base
            url of your repository or if there are any technical issues listed there.
            If there are no technical issues or you do not have an account for the CORE
            Repository Dashboard [contact us](~contact).
      - slug: can-I-upload-a-new-version
        question: |
          There is a mistake in my article, can I upload a new version?
        answer: |
          CORE works at the level of repositories and cannot update specific
          records. You can upload the new record into your institutional
          repository or journal and CORE will synchronise it at the next
          scheduled re-harvesting.
      - slug: there-are-many-new-records-in-my-repository
        question: |
          There are many new records in my repository. Do I need to notify CORE?
        answer: |
          No, CORE follows an automated re-harvesting process and your repository
          will be re-harvested at the next automated re-harvesting.
      - slug: core-vs-google-scholar
        question: |
          How is CORE different from Google Scholar?
        answer: |
          Google Scholar is a search engine containing scholarly research papers but
          it is not designed to aggregate repository and journal systems.
          More specifically:
          - Google Scholar crawls and indexes research papers that can be
            found on the web and links to the original source, while CORE
            harvests and caches the full text.
          - Google Scholar limits its access only at the
            [granularity level](http://www.dlib.org/dlib/november12/knoth/11knoth.html),
            i.e. its search engine, whereas CORE is in position to extend access
            to raw data and, apart from the CORE search engine.
          - Google Scholar offers both closed access and open access resources,
            while CORE offers open access resources only, enabling immediate
            access to full text.
          - The audience is different. Even though CORE has a search engine
            where users can retrieve scientific literature, it focuses also
            on other types of research stakeholders, such as text miners and repository
            managers, and offers services designed for them, such as the
            [CORE API](~api) and [Datasets](~dataset).
      - slug: there-is-no-download-button
        question: |
          I do not see the “Download” button in the CORE display page.
          How can I access the full text?
        answer: |
          CORE harvests content that is available open access elsewhere,
          i.e. repositories and open access journals. When the “Download”
          button is missing, it means that the full text is not available
          from the hosting service, CORE does not have it and displays only the metadata of
          this record. If you need to access the full text we recommend
          that you contact the content provider listed in the CORE
          metadata display page, at the section "Provided by".
      - slug: metadata-in-the-CORE-display-page-are-wrong
        question: |
          The metadata in the CORE display page are wrong. How can I have them corrected?
        answer: |
          CORE does not create the metadata, but rather harvests
          them from its content providers. If the metadata are wrong
          then contact the repository or journal where you had originally
          deposited or published your content.
      - slug: can-CORE-offer-any-statistics-about-the-content-it-harvests
        question: |
          Can CORE offer any statistics about the content it harvests?
        answer: |
          CORE can offer repository or journal full text download statistics per month via the
          [CORE Repository Dashboard](~services#dashboard) but is not in position
          to offer single item downloads yet. If you do not have access to the
          Dashboard [contact us](~contact).
      - slug: are-the-research-papers-offered-by-CORE-peer-reviewed
        question: |
          Are the research papers offered by CORE peer-reviewed?
        answer: |
          Yes it does. CORE harvests content from repositories and journals. The first
          do not perform peer review of the deposited content but the latter
          do. In some occassions the content deposited in a repository is already
          published in a journal and is peer-reviewed. In addition, repositories may contain
          grey literature and these resources are not peer-reviewed.
  - title: 'Aggregation: technical'
    items:
      - slug: what-are-the-technical-requirements-for-being-aggregated
        question: |
          What are the technical requirements for being aggregated?
        answer: |
          In order to realise the data transfer and regular data updates of
          CORE and your system, CORE uses a variety of protocols to ingest
          the content. The easiest way to get your content integrated with CORE
          is the [OAI-PMH protocol](https://www.openarchives.org/pmh/).
          If you wish to join CORE get in [touch](~contact).
      - slug: what-is-my-journal-oai-base-url
        question: |
          What is my journal's oai base url?
        answer: |
          A journal's oai base url looks similar to this http://journaldomain.com/cgi/oai2
          or http://journaldomain.com/oai/request. A journal's webpage looks similar
          to this http://journaldomain.com and CORE
          cannot harvest the journal's content via its webpage url. If you
          are not sure whether your journal has an oai base url do contact
          the team that provides technical support to your journal.
      - slug: how-difficult-is-it-to-satisfy-the-CORE-harvesting-recommendations
        question: |
          How difficult is it to satisfy the CORE harvesting recommendations?
        answer: |
          We would expect that harvesting could take from one hour to a couple of
          days for a typical repository. In some repository systems,
          such as EPrints, most of these recommendations are followed by default.
          You can find more details [here](~recommendations).
      - slug: which-metadata-formats-does-CORE-support
        question: |
          Which metadata formats does CORE support?
        answer: |
          We mainly support oai\_dc, the mainstream metadata format used in the
          [OAI-PMH Protocol](http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html),
          utilising the [Dublin Core](http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/)
          vocabulary, a popular vocabulary for bibliographic data.
          We also support [RIOXX](http://rioxx.net/), a richer metadata
          protocol, used mostly by the UK repositories.
      - slug: can-CORE-just-index-our-content-but-not-store-it-on-its-servers
        question: |
          Can CORE just index our content, but not store it on its servers?
        answer: |
          To provide its service, it is essential for CORE to be able to store
          a cached copy of the harvested content. This is needed to verify open
          access sources, offer analytical services, support text and data mining,
          recommendation tools, etc. By cashing a copy of the harvested
          resource, CORE is not different from many commercial and
          non-commercial, academic and non-academic, search engines including
          [Google](http://www.google.com/) or
          [CiteSeerX](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/index).
          The primary difference from such systems is that CORE caches only
          copies of open access content. More information on the benefits of
          this approach is available in the “[CORE: Three Access Levels to
          Underpin Open Access](http://www.dlib.org/dlib/november12/knoth/11knoth.html)”
          article.
      - slug: can-CORE-stop-caching-PDFs-from-my-repository
        question: |
          Can CORE stop caching the PDFs from my repository?
        answer: |
          CORE can change the way it treats your repository's content. The resources
          will be indexed and made discoverable via the CORE Search, but the PDFs
          will not be downloadble directry from the CORE Reader, a link will be
          provided only to the repository of origin. If you are interested in
          that option [contact](~contact) us.
      - slug:  how-can-my-repository-opt-out-from-being-harvested-by-CORE
        question: |
          How can my repository opt out from being harvested by CORE?
        answer: |
          CORE uses information from various registries, such as
          [OpenDOAR](http://opendoar.org/), to include new repositories,
          journals and archives into CORE. If the circumstances have changed in
          your repository, you can restrict harvesting and crawling activities
          by modifying your rules in your “robots.txt” file by using the
          [Standard for Robots Exclusion](http://www.robotstxt.org/orig.html).
          This will also guarantee the content cannot be cached by search
          engines and harvesting systems. In addition, you could withdraw your
          repository from all open access registries lists; when this takes
          place, please [notify us](~contact).

      - slug: how-does-CORE-ensure-that-the-harvested-content-is-Open-Access
        question: |
          How does CORE ensure that the harvested content is Open Access?
        answer: |
          CORE aggregates content from repositories registered in
          [OpenDOAR](http://www.opendoar.org/about.html), journals registered
          in [DOAJ](http://www.doaj.org/) or those content providers that requested
          their content to be aggregated. This means that all the content sources aggregated
          by CORE must be open access as this is a requirement for the
          providers to be included in these registries. According to the
          official [BOAI definition of open
          access](http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/openaccess/boai-10-recommendations),
          CORE is allowed to, _"distribute, search, or link to the full texts
          of articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software,
          or use them for any other lawful purpose, without financial, legal,
          or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access
          to the Internet itself. The only constraint on reproduction and
          distribution, and the only role for copyright in this domain is to
          give authors control over the integrity of their work and the right
          to be properly acknowledged and cited."_
      - slug: CORE-harvests-copyrighted-material-from-my-repository
        question: |
          CORE harvests copyrighted material from my repository
        answer: |
          CORE’s system is fully automated and relies on data made available in
          a machine readable form. If your repository hosts full text with a
          restrictive license that prohibits harvesting, this needs to be
          properly communicated in a machine readable form. All non open access
          items should be blocked in the robots.txt file. If this information
          is provided in the metadata for each record and CORE exposes the
          full text, please get in [touch with us](~contact).
      - slug: full-text-record-is-deleted-from-my-repository
        question: |
          A full text record is deleted from my repository, but is still available in CORE
        answer: |
          CORE’s system is fully automated and relies on data made available
          in a machine readable form. Our system understands that the
          full text of a record was removed only when the record is marked
          as deleted in the metadata of your repository. See [here]
          (#how-do-I-notify-CORE-to-take-down-full-text-content)
          how to take down full text from CORE.
      - slug: how-do-I-notify-CORE-to-take-down-full-text-content
        question: |
          How do I notify CORE to take down full text content?
        answer: |
          If full text content appears in CORE but not in the
          hosting service your repository manager can take it down via the
          [CORE Repository Dashboard](~services#dashboard)
          anytime without notifying us. If the hosting service does not have
          access to the Dashboard visit [this page](path___core_display_form).
      - slug: full-text-has-been-removed-but-metadata-still-visible
        question: |
          The full text has been removed, but the metadata is still visible
          in CORE
        answer: |
          It is a CORE policy to remove only the full text and not
          the metadata.
      - slug: why-metadata-is-still-visible
        question: |
          I have removed an item from my repository, but the metadata are still
          visible in CORE
        answer: |
          In order for the metadata to be removed from CORE they need to be
          marked as "deleted/removed" in the repository. If the metadata are
          marked as "restricted" CORE will still display it.

          If you plan to use the CORE API we kindly ask the following:
          - attribute CORE by including in your website
            [this snippet](#powered-by-CORE-snippet),
          - send us [an email](~contact) with a brief summary on
            how you are using the CORE API,
          - grant us permission to present this summary to our funders and/or
            display it on our website,

        question: |
          Does CORE offer a higher download quota of the CORE API?
        answer: |
          Yes, this is possible but there is usually a cost associated with it.
          Please [email us](~contact) the name of your
          company or organisation, business entity, the number of requests you
          estimate to send and how often you will send them and we will get
          back to your with a quote.

        question: |
          Can I use the CORE API for commercial purposes?
        answer: |
          Yes, you can use the CORE API for commercial purposes, but you need
          to contact us first and let us know about it. Commercial use of our
          API could increase the traffic in our servers and we would like to be
          aware of the expected traffic.
      - slug: can-I-use-the-CORE-dataset-for-commercial-purposes
        question: |
          Can I use the CORE dataset for commercial purposes?
        answer: |
          Please note the dataset has been created from information that was
          publicly available on the Internet. Every effort has been made
          to ensure this dataset contains only open access content.
          We have included only content from repositories and journals that
          are listed in registries where the condition for inclusion is the
          provision of content under open access compatible license. However,
          as metadata are often inconsistent, licensed information is often not
          machine readable, and repositories from time to time leak information
          that is not open access, we cannot take any responsibility for the
          license of the content in the dataset. It is therefore up to the user
          of this dataset to ensure that the way in which they use the dataset
          does not breach copyright. The dataset is in no way intended for the
          purposes of reading the original publications, but for machine
          processing only.
      - slug: how-often-is-the-CORE-dataset-updated?
        question: |
          How often is the CORE dataset updated?
        answer: |
          We aim to generate a new public dataset at least once a year.
          If you need a more recent dataset, please [get in touch](~contact)
          with us as we might be able to arrange it.
      - slug: how-can-I-download-the-CORE-Recommender
        question: |
          How can I download the CORE Recommender?
        answer: |
          If you have access to the CORE Repositories Dashboard, log into the
          [Dashboard](~services/repository-dashboard) and you will get the
          instructions on how to download the
          [CORE Recommender](~services/recommender).
          Otherwise, visit our recommender
          [registration page](~recommenders/register),
          where you will also find the installation instructions. Repository
          managers are highly recommended to use the CORE Repositories
          Dashboard.
      - slug: I-am-not-pleased-with-the-similar-papers
        question: |
          When I look at the papers I have authored, I am not pleased with the
          similar papers suggested by the CORE Recommender. How can I change that?
        answer: |
          The CORE recommender uses the popular [content-based filtering
          system](https://blog.core.ac.uk/2016/10/04/core-recommender/).
          The similar resources that appear in the CORE Recommender and their
          quality are highly impacted by the metadata information supplied by
          the repository of origin. If that information is incorrect or
          incomplete, you should contact the repository of origin. To improve
          the CORE recommendations, you can use the feedback button, with which you
          can remove any undesirable articles.
