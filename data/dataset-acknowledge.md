title: How to acknowledge the use of CORE
---

1.  resources coming from CORE in an appropriate way (e.g. by linking the
    entities coming from a particular CORE document, by giving a provenance
    link back to this document in CORE, etc.)
2.  the use of CORE. We expect an attribution at the project’s main page by using
    [CORE’s logo](https://core.ac.uk/resources/corelogo_hires.png) or the
    [powered by CORE](https://core.ac.uk/images/powered-by-core-orange.png)
    picture.


If your project is producing any research papers mentioning CORE, you support
this mention by means of an explicit citation to a relevant paper listed
in our [research outputs](~about/research-outputs).
            
You authorise us to use the logo of your project on our website and
mentioning our support to you.

We reserve the right to withdraw our approval for use of CORE at any time
by giving you a 30-day notice.
