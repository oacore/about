  The CORE Publisher Connector is a software providing seamless access to
  Gold and Hybrid Gold Open Access articles aggregated from non-standard
  systems of major publishers. CORE now harvests from several publishers
  using the Publisher connector engine, which offers a unique way of accessing
  scientific content from scholarly publishers. Data is exposed via the
  ResourceSync protocol.

  ResourceSync is a protocol that overcomes the limitations of the OAI-PMH
  protocol; goes further than just metadata exchange, enables sharing of
  any kind of resource and offers advanced synchronization mechanisms over
  the web.

  CORE is one of the first to deploy ResourceSync for distributing large
  amounts of scholarly literature that scales to millions of items and
  is capable of real-time updates. In our deployment of ResourceSync,
  we utilise the generic notion of a resource in the protocol and share
  more than one representation, i.e. each record contains both metadata and
  full text.

  If you use CORE in your work, we kindly request you to cite one of
  our publications.
