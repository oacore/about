title: CORE API
---
![CORE API image](images/api-core.png)

CORE harvests, maintains, enriches and makes available metadata and full-text
content (typically a PDF) from many Open Access journals and repositories.
This makes it a useful access point for those who would like to develop
applications making use of this content. To support these activities, CORE is
providing a free API.

If you use CORE in your work, we kindly request you to cite one of our
[publications](research-outputs).

## Documentation

The documentation, along with live examples can be found
[here](al-swagger-ui-home).

You can also view some practical examples using the CORE API in this [TDM
course](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/node/2263).

## Expected use

We expect the API can be used, for example, to:

- Perform text mining to enrich metadata of Open Access publications or to
- even perform different kinds of semantic analysis of publications.
- Semantically annotate (by means of crowdsourcing, collaborative sharing or
- natural language processing) the publications to drive the emergence of
- nano-publications in certain research fields. Link publications to research
- data. Carry out impact and citation analysis in the Open Access domain. Many
- other services that need quick and easy access to the content of research
- publications, etc.

## Where to start

Please register [here](apikeys-register) to receive an API key and start
testing the [live examples](al-swagger-ui-home).

A good starting point to start coding with our API is to follow the iPython
notebook available [on Github](https://github.com/oacore/or2016-api-demo).

In collaboration with [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org) you can find
[here](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/cored) an _R_ client for the CORE API.

## Quota

We apply a quota to the API to allow fair access and a high response time to
our services. Please [get in touch](contact) if you require accessing
our API at a faster rate.   The quota for each method are listed in the
following tables:

## CORE data as Linked Open Data (LOD)

Apart from the CORE API, CORE also provides data as LOD for enthusiasts. The
documentation is available at the [datahub](https://datahub.io/dataset/core).
Please note the data is not synced regularly. We encourage all developers to
use the CORE API v2.
