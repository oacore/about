tagline: Develop new applications with the CORE API
description: |
  CORE harvests, maintains, enriches and makes available metadata
  and full text content - typically a PDF - from many open access journals
  and repositories. This makes it a useful access point for those
  who would like to develop applications making use of this content.
  To support these activities, CORE is providing a free API.

  title: Where to start?
  content: |
    Please [register to receive an API key](/api-keys/register)
    and start testing the [live examples](/documentation/api).

    A good starting point to start coding with our API is to
    follow the iPython notebook available on [Github](https://github.com/oacore/or2016-api-demo).
    In collaboration with [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) you can find [here](https://github.com/ropensci/rcoreoa)
    an R client for the CORE API.

testimonial:
  content: |
    We are integrating the CORE API into our product, IRIS, because so far it
    is the open access portal that covers almost all open access content,
    provides easy to integrate API and has a powerful search querying engine.
    We want to make open access articles more easily accessible and more useful
    to researchers and the open public and we see the CORE API as a way
    to speed that up.
