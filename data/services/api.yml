main: |
  CORE collects, processess, harmonises and enriches [large quantities](~data) of metadata and full texts of research papers from many [data providers](~about/#how-it-works). On top of this continuously growing collection, we provide a truly unique API offering real-time machine access to both metadata and full texts of research papers, enabling developers to build and run innovative applications on top of CORE's content.

  If you use CORE in your work, we kindly request you to [cite one
  of our publications](~research-outputs).

  title: Where to start?
  content: |
    Please [register to receive an API key](/api-keys/register)
    and start testing the [live examples](/documentation/api).

    A good starting point to start coding with our API is to
    follow the iPython notebook available on [Github](https://github.com/oacore/or2016-api-demo).
    In collaboration with [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) you can find
    an [R client for the CORE API](https://github.com/ropensci/rcoreoa) in the GitHub repository.
    All our SDKs are available from [our GitHub organisation](https://github.com/oacore).

testimonial:
  content: |
    We are integrating the CORE API into our product, IRIS, because so far it
    is the open access portal that covers almost all open access content,
    provides easy to integrate API and has a powerful search querying engine.
    We want to make open access articles more easily accessible and more useful
    to researchers and the open public and we see the CORE API as a way
    to speed that up.
