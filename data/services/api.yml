  CORE harvests, maintains, enriches and makes available metadata and full-text content (typically a PDF)
  from many Open Access journals and repositories. This makes it a useful access point for those who would like
  to develop applications making use of this content. To support these activities, CORE is providing a free API.

  If you use CORE in your work, we kindly request you to cite (one of our publications).

testimonial:
  content: |
    We are integrating CORE API into our product, IRIS, because so far it is the open access portal that
    covers almost all open access content, provides easy to integrate API and has a powerful search
    querying engine. We want to make open access articles more easily accessible and more useful to
    researchers and the open public and we see CORE API as a way to speed that up.
