  CORE harvests, maintains, enriches and makes available metadata
  and full-text content (typically a PDF) from many Open Access journals
  and repositories. This makes it a useful access point for those
  who would like to develop applications making use of this content.
  To support these activities, CORE is providing a free API.

  If you use CORE in your work, we kindly request you to cite one
  of our publications.

    Please register here to receive an API key and start testing the
    live examples. A good starting point to start coding with our API is to
    follow the iPython notebook available on Github. In collaboration with
    rOpenSci you can find here an R client for the CORE API.

    We are integrating CORE API into our product, IRIS, because so far it
    is the open access portal that covers almost all open access content,
    provides easy to integrate API and has a powerful search querying engine.
    We want to make open access articles more easily accessible and more useful
    to researchers and the open public and we see CORE API as a way
    to speed that up.
