  title: How it works
  image: /images/services/work.svg
  description: |
    CORE collects, harmonises and enriches large quantities of both metadata and full text research articles from thousands of [data providers](/data-providers). On top of this continuously growing corpus, we provide a truly unique API providing real-time machine access to both the metadata and full texts of research papers, enabling developers to build and run innovative applications on top of CORE's content.

   “We are integrating the CORE API into our product, IRIS, because so far it is the open access portal that covers almost all open access content, provides easy to integrate API and has a powerful search querying engine. We want to make open access articles more easily accessible and more useful to researchers and the open public and we see the CORE API as a way to speed that up.”
