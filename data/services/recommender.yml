  The recommender is a plugin for repositories, journal systems and web interfaces that provides suggestions
  on relevant articles to the one currently displayed. Its purpose is to support users in discovering
  articles of interest from across the network of open access repositories. We have validated that
  all recommended articles are free to read and can be accessed without a paywall. Thus, the CORE
  Recommender increases the visibility of open access content. Being open should pay off!

  Uniqueness of the CORE Recommender:
  * We ensure that the recommended articles are available open access, ensuring that what
  gets recommended can also be freely read.
  * Our state-of-the-art recommendation algorithm makes use of article full texts, not just
  metadata, in addition to a wide range of other features. Read more on how the algorithm
  works in our [research](~research-outputs) section.
  * We provide our recommendation service for free and the installation is straightforward.
