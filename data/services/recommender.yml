  The recommender is a plugin that can be installed in repositories,

  to what they read.

  Uniqueness of the CORE Recommender:
  * Our methods rely on the availability of full texts.
  * We do not base our recommendations solely on abstracts
    or metadata but on full text.
  * We ensure that the recommended articles are available
    open access. We provide our recommendation service for free, by using
    a machine accessible interface (API).

  If you use CORE in your work, we kindly request you to cite one
  of [our publications](~research-outputs).
