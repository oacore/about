  The recommender is a plugin that can be installed in repositories and 
  journal systems to suggest similar articles. Its purpose is to support 
  users in finding articles relevant to what they read.
 
  Uniqueness of the CORE Recommender:
  Our methods rely on the availability of full-texts. 
  We donâ€™t base our recommendations solely on abstracts 
  or metadata. We ensure that the recommended articles are available 
  open access. We provide our recommendation service for free, by using 
  a machine accessible interface (API).
  
  If you use CORE in your work, we kindly request you to cite one of our publications.

    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
    Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since
    the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled
    it to make a type specimen book.
