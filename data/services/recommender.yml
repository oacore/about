  The recommender is a plugin that can be installed in repositories and
  journal systems to suggest similar articles. Its purpose is to support
  users in finding articles relevant to what they read.

  Uniqueness of the CORE Recommender:
  * Our methods rely on the availability of full-texts.
  * We don’t base our recommendations solely on abstracts
    or metadata.
  * We ensure that the recommended articles are available
    open access. We provide our recommendation service for free, by using
    a machine accessible interface (API).

  If you use CORE in your work, we kindly request you to cite one
  of [our publications](~research-outputs).
