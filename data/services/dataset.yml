    Benefit by working effectively with large amounts of data.

  The data aggregated from repositories by the CORE system can be accessed in two ways, 
  through the CORE API or by downloading the data to your computer. The former option 
  is practical if you want to build a service on top of CORE while the latter is something 
  we recommend to those who would like to analyse the CORE dataset and/or apply some 
  computationally intensive batch processes.
 
  If you use CORE in your work, we kindly request you to cite one of our publications.

disclaimer: 
  content: | 
    This dataset has been created from information that was publicly available on the Internet. 
    Every effort has been made to ensure this dataset contains open access content only. 
    We have included content only from repositories and journals that are listed in registries 
    where the condition for inclusion is the provision of content under an open access compatible 
    license. However, as metadata are often inconsistent, license information is often not machine 
    readable and, from time to time, repositories leak information that is not open access, 
    we cannot take any responsibility for the license of the content in the dataset. It is 
    therefore up to the user of this dataset to ensure that the way in which they use the 
    dataset does not breach copyright. The dataset is in no way intended for the purposes of 
    reading the original publications, but for machine processing only.
