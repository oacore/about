  description: |
    CORE data can be downloaded as a bulk dataset, allowing you to process it on your own computer or within your infrastructure. The dataset provides a harmonised and enriched data format for access content from across our [data providers](/data-providers). This is perfect for prototyping new methods, especially when intensive data processes need to be run. It is also a good choice for data analysis and text mining.

      “To build the product we have always envisioned, having a robust and comprehensive dataset of machine-readable, peer-reviewed papers is absolutely essential. We are incredibly grateful to be able to partner with an organization like CORE that not only can meet our data needs, but also shares our vision of making science more accessible and consumable. This unique combination of best-in-class data-offering and mission-alignment makes CORE an ideal partner for Consensus.”
