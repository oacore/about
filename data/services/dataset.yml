main: |
  CORE data can be downloaded as a bulk dataset, allowing you to process it on your own computer or within your infrastructure. The dataset provides a harmonised and enriched data format for access content from across our [data providers](~data-providers/). This is perfect for prototyping new methods, especially when intensive data processes need to be run. It is also a good choice for data analysis and text mining.

  If you use CORE in your work, we kindly request you to
  [cite one of our publications](~research-outputs).
