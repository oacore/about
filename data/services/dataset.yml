tagline: Download millions of research outputs for text and data analysis
description: |
  The data aggregated from repositories by CORE can be accessed in
  two ways, through the CORE API or by downloading the data to your computer.
  The former option is practical if you want to build a service on top of CORE
  while the latter is something we recommend to those who would like to analyse
  the CORE dataset and/or apply some computationally intensive batch processes.

    ### Disclaimer

    This dataset has been created from information that was publicly available
    on the Internet. Every effort has been made to ensure this dataset contains
    open access content only. We have included content only from repositories
    and journals that are listed in registries where the condition for
    inclusion is the provision of content under an open access compatible
    license. However, as metadata are often inconsistent, license information
    is often not machine readable and, from time to time, repositories leak
    information that is not open access, we cannot take any responsibility
    for the license of the content in the dataset. It is therefore up to
    the user of this dataset to ensure that the way in which they use the
    dataset does not breach copyright. The dataset is in no way intended
    for the purposes of reading the original publications, but for machine
    processing only.
