    Benefit by working effectively with large amounts of data.


description: |
  The data aggregated from repositories by the CORE system can be accessed in
  two ways, through the CORE API or by downloading the data to your computer.
  The former option is practical if you want to build a service on top of CORE
  while the latter is something we recommend to those who would like to analyse
  the CORE dataset and/or apply some computationally intensive batch processes.

  If you use CORE in your work, we kindly request you to
  [cite one of our publications](~research-outputs).

    ### 2018 onwards

    **Dataset 2018-03-01**

    [Register for Access](~join#dataset)

    Metadata only dataset (beta) (127 GB) - 123M metadata items,
    85.6M items with abstract

    With full text dataset (beta) (330 GB) - 123M metadata items,
    85.6M items with abstract, 9.8M items with fulltext

    **Note:**
    For extracting all repositories, you will need up to 509 GB (metadata)
    or 1.3 TB (full text) of free space on disk. It is possible to extract
    each repository individually. Please read the section
    ["Structure of the dumps"](#dump-structure) below for more information.

    ### 2017

    **Dataset 2017-11-01**

    [Register for Access](~join#dataset)

    Metadata only dataset (beta) (22.65 GB) - 64 million items

    With full text dataset (beta) (157.38 GB) - 8 million items

    Beta notice: while in beta, we cannot guarantee completeness
    or integrity of the dataset and we appreciate any feedback on the
    format or data of the dataset. We are aware of an issue where
    the statistics in the repository object are incorrect or incomplete.
    We do not use these fields internally and plan on removing them
    in future releases.

  content: |
    This dataset has been created from information that was publicly available
    on the Internet. Every effort has been made to ensure this dataset contains
    open access content only. We have included content only from repositories
    and journals that are listed in registries where the condition for
    inclusion is the provision of content under an open access compatible
    license. However, as metadata are often inconsistent, license information
    is often not machine readable and, from time to time, repositories leak
    information that is not open access, we cannot take any responsibility
    for the license of the content in the dataset. It is therefore up to
    the user of this dataset to ensure that the way in which they use the
    dataset does not breach copyright. The dataset is in no way intended
    for the purposes of reading the original publications, but for machine
    processing only.
