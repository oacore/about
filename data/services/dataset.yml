main: |
  CORE data can be downloaded as a bulk dataset, allowing you to process it on your own computer or within your infrastructure. The dataset provides a harmonised and enriched data format for access content from across our [data providers](~data/providers/). This is perfect for prototyping new methods, especially when intensive data processes need to be run. It is also a good choice for data analysis and text mining.

  If you use CORE in your work, we kindly request you to
  [cite one of our publications](~research-outputs).

    The dataset is free to use for non-commercial purposes. If you want to use the dataset for
    commercial purposes, including consultancies and commercial analysis, please [contact](~about/#contact) us.
    The dataset provides you with:

    * The entire CORE's corpus of both metadata and full texts in a machine processable format.
    * Mappings of the CORE articles to entities in the Micrsoft Academic Graph (MAG), enabling to access
      CORE fulltexts and use additional entities from MAG where available.
    * Detailed [documentation](~documentation/dataset) on how to download the CORE dataset and how data is organised.

    ### Disclaimer

    This dataset has been created from information that was publicly available
    on the Internet. Every effort has been made to ensure this dataset contains
    open access content only. We have included content only from repositories
    and journals that are listed in registries where the condition for
    inclusion is the provision of content under an open access compatible
    license. However, as metadata are often inconsistent, license information
    is often not machine readable and, from time to time, repositories leak
    information that is not open access, we cannot take any responsibility
    for the license of the content in the dataset. It is therefore up to
    the user of this dataset to ensure that the way in which they use the
    dataset does not breach copyright. The dataset is in no way intended
    for the purposes of reading the original publications, but for machine
    processing only.
