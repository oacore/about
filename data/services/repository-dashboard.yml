  The Repository Dashboard is a free service for our data providers. It
  provides an online interface offering valuable technical information and
  statistics to content providers. It is the tool you need to check that your
  repository is configured correctly to provide maximum visibility to your
  research outputs. The Repository Dashboard has been created in an effort to
  improve the quality and transparency of the harvesting process of open
  access content and to create a two way collaboration between the CORE
  project and our data providers.

testimonial:
  content: |
    The CORE Repository Dashboard provides an excellent level of
    feedback and control over what gets harvested, aggregated and exposed.
    It also provides intelligence on harvesting errors which may need
    troubleshooting, thereby ensuring optimum repository health for text mining
    as well as discovery of repository content.
