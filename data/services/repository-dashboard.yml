  content: |
    The CORE Repository Dashboard provides an excellent level of
    feedback and control over what gets harvested, aggregated and exposed.
    It also provides intelligence on harvesting errors which may need
    troubleshooting, thereby ensuring optimum repository health for text mining
    as well as discovery of repository content.
