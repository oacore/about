  In an effort to improve the quality and transparency of the harvesting process
  of the open access content and create a two way collaboration between the CORE
  project and the providers of this content, CORE is introducing the
  Repositories Dashboard.

  The aim of the Dashboard is to provide an online interface for repository
  providers and offer, through this online interface, valuable information to
  content providers.

  If you use CORE in your work, we kindly request you to cite one of our p
  ublications.
