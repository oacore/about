    #### Discoverability

    By integrating with CORE, a repository can make their content far more
    visible than as a standalone institution. This is achieved by CORE
    exposing the content via [CORE Search](~services/search), [CORE
    Discovery](~services/discovery) browser extension, [CORE
    Recommender](~services/recommender) and [many other](~services) widely
    used scholarly infrastructure services including PubMed and Microsoft
    Academic.

    On average a repository’s membership in CORE [increases total overall
    downloads of content][increase-blog-post] by an average of 15% and up to
    32.5% for repositories following interoperability guidelines. All
    downloads from CORE are monitored and attributable back to the originating
    repository which means that the HEI remains in full control of its usage
    data.

    Subscription to CORE Repository Edition means that a repository has a
    guaranteed re-harvesting rate of a maximum of 14 days to ensure rapid
    discoverability of new content.

    #### Functionality

    CORE Repository Edition comes with full access to an enhanced [CORE
    Repository Dashboard](~services/repository-dashboard).

    Research England announced they will be using CORE data in the [REF 2021
    OA Audit](~ref-audit). CORE provides to subscribing UK HEIs tools to
    prepare their REF submission and avoid submitting non-compliant outputs.

    * REF 2021 OA deposit compliance information for hosted content.
    * Cross-repository REF 2021 compliance matching.

    Additionally, [CORE enriches repository’s data][enrich-paper] by
    triangulating with Microsoft Academic Graph, Crossref and others to gather
    missing identifiers and improve the quality and accuracy of existing data
    in repositories.  More specifically, the enhanced CORE Repository
    Dashboard offers DOI data enrichment for repositories.

    Finally, CORE provides a powerful range of add-on tools for repositories
    that enhance the control of content for repository managers and improve
    the end-user experience. These repository plugins include:

    * [Discovery](~services/discovery) – automatically guide users to Open
      Access versions of content where this content is not hosted by the
      repository itself.
    * [Recommender](~services/recommender) – greatly enhances a repository's
      own search functionality.

    #### Support

    Subscription to CORE Repository Edition comes with guaranteed customer
    support services. Initial help is provided to ensure interoperability of
    the repository with CORE and other services. This includes data schemas,
    such as RIOXX, developed for UK funders to link funded projects with
    research outputs. While continuous monitoring, issue detection and
    tracking tools are provided in the [CORE Repository
    Dashboard](~services/repository-dashboard), CORE Repository Edition users
    can rely on dedicated technical support.

    Additional support is also offered to enable repositories to gain maximum
    exposure for their content.

    Support services are provided with an average response time of **1 business
    day**.

    In addition to all the listed benefits, you will become part of the CORE
    network of institutions and receive recognition of your institution
    supporting open access. If you agree, the logo of your institution will be
    placed in the public list of CORE supporters.
