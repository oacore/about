  CORE Discovery helps users to discover freely accessible copies of research
  papers. It is backed by our [huge dataset](~data) of millions of full text
  open access papers as well as content from widely used external services
  beyond CORE. Discovery reduces the time it takes to access full texts of
  research papers and the frustration associated with hitting a paywall on the
  publisher's site. With CORE Discovery, you can be confident to benefit from
  the highest coverage of freely available copies of articles anywhere on the
  planet. So try it, it's free.

  The tool is available as:
  * Browser extension for researchers and anyone interested in reading
    scientific documents
  * Plugin for repositories, enriching metadata only pages in repositories
    with links to freely available copies of the paper
  * API for developers and third party services

  ### How it works?

  Our service processes information from a wide number of authoritative
  scholarly data sources to discover, download and validate information
  about free availability of articles wherever they are located on the web.
  In this way, we are curating a vast database of freely available copies
  of articles. CORE Discovery has a preference for displaying first the open
  access content, originating from our approved content providers, and seeks
  alternative routes, providing access to free versions, only if they
  are not available from them.

  content: |
    Our free CORE Discovery service provides you with:

    * **Highest coverage of freely available content.**
      Our tests have shown that CORE Discovery delivers state-of-the-art
      performance compared to other discovery tools in terms of both content
      coverage (finding a freely available copy when it is available) and
      precision (reliably delivering a free copy of the paper on success).
    * **Free service for researchers by researchers.**
      CORE Discovery is the only free content discovery extension developed
      by researchers for researchers. There is no major publisher
      or enterprise controlling and profiting from your usage data.
    * **Best grip on open repository content.**
      Due to CORE being a leader in harvesting open access literature,
      CORE Discovery has the best grip on open content from open repositories
      as opposed to other services that disproportionately focus only
      on content indexed in major commercial databases.
    * **Repository integration and discovering documents without a DOI.**
      The only service offering seamless and free integration
      into repositories. CORE Discovery is also the only discovery system
      that can locate scientific content even for items with
      an unknown DOI or which do not have a DOI.
