  CORE Discovery is a new service assists users in finding freely
  accessible copies of research papers that behind a paywall.
  It currently provides access to millions of full text open access
  papers from within CORE and other data providers.

  The service processes and validates information from a number
  of large third party scholarly data sources to build and maintain
  a database of links pointing to freely available copies. It also
  relies on information harvested by CORE from thousands of repositories
  and journals, meaning that CORE discovery maximises the coverage and
  accuracy of the Discovery service.

  CORE Discovery has a preference in displaying first the
  open access content originating from our approved content providers
  and seeks alternative routes only when a free version is not available
  from them.
