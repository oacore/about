  CORE Discovery helps users to discover freely accessible copies of research
  papers that are behind a paywall on the publisher's site. It is backed
  by our [huge dataset](~data) of millions of full text open access
  papers as well as content from widely used external services beyond CORE.

  Our service processes information from a wide number of authoritative
  scholarly data sources to discover, download and validate information
  about free availability of articles wherever they are located on the web.
  In this way, we are curating a vast database of freely available copies
  of articles. CORE Discovery has a preference for displaying first the open
  access content, originating from our approved content providers, and seeks
  alternative routes, providing access to free versions, only if they
  are not available from them.

  With CORE Discovery, you can be confident to benefit from the highest
  coverage of freely available copies of articles anywhere on the planet.
  So try it, it's free.

  CORE Discovery can also be integrated into third party systems using our
  CORE Discovery API.
