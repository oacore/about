  description: |
    Our service processes information from a wide number of authoritative scholarly data sources to discover, download and validate information about free availability of articles wherever they are located on the web. In this way, we are curating a vast database of freely available copies of articles. CORE Discovery has a preference for displaying first the open access content, originating from our approved content providers, and seeks alternative routes, providing access to free versions, only if they are not available from them.

    CORE Discovery helps users to discover freely accessible copies of research papers. It is backed by our huge dataset of millions of full text open access papers as well as content from widely used external services beyond CORE. Discovery reduces the time it takes to access full texts of research papers and the frustration associated with hitting a paywall on the publisher's site. With CORE Discovery, you can be confident to benefit from the highest coverage of freely available copies of articles anywhere on the planet.

    - title: Highest coverage of freely available content
      description: |
        Our tests have shown that CORE Discovery delivers state-of-the-art
        performance compared to other discovery tools in terms of both content
        coverage (finding a freely available copy when it is available) and
        precision (reliably delivering a free copy of the paper on success).

      description: |
        CORE Discovery is the only free content discovery extension developed
        by researchers for researchers. There is no major publisher
        or enterprise controlling and profiting from your usage data.

    - title: Best grip on open repository content.
      description: |
        Due to CORE being a leader in indexing open access literature,
        CORE Discovery has the best grip on open content from open repositories
        as opposed to other services that disproportionately focus only
        on content indexed in major commercial databases.

      description: |
        The only service offering seamless and free integration
        into repositories. CORE Discovery is also the only discovery system
        that can locate scientific content even for items with
        an unknown DOI or which do not have a DOI.
