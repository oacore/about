    By integrating with CORE, we have significantly increased the number of
    research papers in the Naver Academic indexes. In fact, CORE is Naver’s largest
    provider of full text content. CORE’s data are now synchronised with Naver
    using CORE FastSync, reducing the amount of effort that would be needed
    to collect these data in traditional ways.
