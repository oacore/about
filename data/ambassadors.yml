  Spreading knowledge around the world
content: |
  While the adoption of open access, open data, open science and text mining
  practices are growing, CORE is proud to follow these developments and grow
  as a service. We are looking for enthusiastic organizations and individuals
  to volunteer as ambassadors to spread the word about CORE’s
  [mission](~about#mission) and [services](~services).

  Become a CORE ambassador to enhance CORE’s efforts in advancing open access
  and supporting text-mining in your area by:

  * Updating the CORE Team with the community's feedback about our services
  * Identifying repositories in your country harvested by CORE
  * Offering advice with regards to key national initiatives and projects in the
    area of open access infrastructure in your country
  * Presenting CORE to research stakeholders at local venues
  * Posting CORE news on blogs and social media
  * Sharing information about CORE to local mailing lists, venues and contacts
  * Posting CORE news on blogs and social media


  CORE will offer support to ambassadors on a regular basis by:

  * Building a correspondence with ambassadors via emails and/or phone
  * Offering a dedicated area where the ambassadors’ presentations can be stored
    and retrieved
  * Acknowledging an ambassador’s name and affiliated organization
    on the CORE website
  * Shipping promotional material (whenever funding permits it).

  In addition, the CORE ambassadors will be the first to have access
  to new CORE services.
