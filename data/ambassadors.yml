    While the adoption of open access, open data, open science and text mining
    practices are growing, CORE is proud to follow these developments and grow
    as a service. We are looking for enthusiastic organisations and individuals
    to volunteer as ambassadors to spread the word about CORE’s
    [mission](~about#mission) and [services](~services).

    Become a CORE ambassador to enhance CORE’s efforts in advancing open access
    and supporting text-mining in your area by:

    * Presenting CORE to research stakeholders (students,
      librarians and researchers).
    * Posting CORE news on blogs and social media.
    * Sharing information about CORE to listservers (especially local).
    * Presenting CORE during events and conferences.
    * Updating the CORE Team with the community’s feedback.

    CORE will offer support to ambassadors on a regular basis by:

    * Building a correspondence with ambassadors via emails and/or phone.
    * Organising skype calls every two months.
    * Offering a dedicated area where the ambassadors’ presentations can be stored
      and retrieved.
    * Acknowledging an ambassador’s name and affiliated organisation
      on the CORE website.
    * Shipping promotional material (whenever funding permits it).

    In addition, the CORE ambassadors will be the first to have access
    to new CORE services.
