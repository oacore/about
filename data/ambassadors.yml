  Spreading knowledge around the world
content: |
  While the adoption of open access, open data, open science and text mining
  practices are growing, CORE is proud to follow these developments and grow
  as a service. We are looking for enthusiastic organizations and individuals
  to volunteer as ambassadors to spread the word about CORE’s
  [mission](~about#mission) and [services](~services).

  Become a CORE ambassador to enhance CORE’s efforts in advancing open access
  and supporting text-mining in your area by:

  * Presenting CORE to research stakeholders (students,
    librarians and researchers).
  * Posting CORE news on blogs and social media.
  * Sharing information about CORE to listservers (especially local).
  * Presenting CORE during events and conferences.
  * Updating the CORE Team with the community’s feedback.

  CORE will offer support to ambassadors on a regular basis by:

  * Building a correspondence with ambassadors via emails and/or phone.
  * Organizing Skype calls every two months.
  * Offering a dedicated area where the ambassadors’ presentations can be stored
    and retrieved.
  * Acknowledging an ambassador’s name and affiliated organization
    on the CORE website.
  * Shipping promotional material (whenever funding permits it).

  In addition, the CORE ambassadors will be the first to have access
  to new CORE services.
