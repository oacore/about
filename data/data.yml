      Aspiring for completeness
    content: |
      While other bibliographic databases only include scholarly works with registered DOIs, CORE is able to find and index in addition scholarly works without them. In fact, about half of CORE’s works do not have a DOI. Those works are missing in most other scholarly databases, making CORE truly unique and a necessity for any service that cannot afford to omit important studies.
