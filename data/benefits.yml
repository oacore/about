     Inclusion in CORE ensures the widest possible dissemination of your
     open access content, resulting in increased visibility and
     discoverability of your papers. We achieve this by promoting your
     content to over 30 million monthly active users of CORE.
     Your content will be discoverable not just in CORE Search,
     but also across the open access network, within the systems of
     hundreds of data providers using the CORE Recommender
     (such as arxiv.org) and CORE Discovery plugins.
     We also integrate with PMC LinkOut and there are dozens of
     mission-driven third-party services that have been built on top
     of our aggregated data, such as the Pocket Open Access mobile app
     and the Lean Library discovery service. By cooperating with
     world-leading plagiarism detection solutions, we also facilitate
     early-detection and prevention of misuse of content produced by
     your staff.

     A study of 21 UK institutions carried out in 2019 showed that
     when a repository is harvested by CORE, the number of content
     downloads increases by 15% on average and up to 32% if the
     repository is well configured for harvesting.

    description: |
      Identifiers of metadata records harvested by CORE are
      automatically registered as globally unique persistent
      identifiers (PIDs). CORE uses for this purpose
      [OAI identifiers](/documentation/oai-resolver)
      that have been almost universaly adopted across the network of
      open access repositories and publishers. OAI identifiers are
      viable PIDs for repositories, publishers and archives that can be,
      as opposed to DOIs, minted in a distributed fashion and cost-free,
      and that are resolvable directly to the data provider rather than,
      as is typical with DOIs, to the publisher’s website. As a result,
      OAIs are highly suitable identifiers supporting the green
      (self-archiving) route to Open Access, envisaged by the Budapest Open
      Access Initiative. Data providers are encouraged to freely register
      their OAI prefix with CORE (using the CORE Dashboard) to benefit from
      our global [OAI Resolver](https://oai.core.ac.uk/).

      In the context of rapidly increasing open access policies
      (such as REF, UKRI or Plan S) and best practices (such as FAIR),
      CORE can improve the understanding of your content’s status and
      help you prepare analytical reports for research administrators
      and funders. For example, CORE conducted the UK REF2021 open
      access audit, verifying when outputs became publicly available as
      open access.

      By being included in CORE, your infrastructure contributes to the
      national and international monitoring of open access content
      growth and enables the prediction of new trends in scientific
      disciplines. Join our vast network of interoperable repositories
      and journals and take advantage of metadata  enrichments,
      e.g. recommendations, DOIs, ORCID iDs, etc.

    description: |
      Open access content hosted in repository and journal platforms is
      typically not easily usable in  analytical, text and data mining
      tasks. However, creators of innovative research tools, funders and
      researchers themselves frequently need research content in a
      well-structured machine readable format, a prerequisite for a wide
      range of use cases, including domain specific research search
      engines, plagiarism detection, fact checking and misinformation
      detection, research graphs, rapid systematic reviews, detection of
      research trends, research assessment, identifying suitable
      peer-reviewers, recommender systems, innovation engineering,
      compliance monitoring, etc. CORE provides access to open access
      content in a machine readable format doing all the heavy lifting
      with the help of AI. This involves harmonising metadata, cleaning
      and creating a structured representation of scholarly data.
