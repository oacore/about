## Disclaimer

The term **CORE data** refers to a database created by harvesting and
processing information publicly available on the Internet. Every effort has
been made to ensure this dataset contains open access content only. We have
included content only from repositories and journals that are listed in
registries where the condition for inclusion is the provision of content
under an open access compatible license. However, as metadata are often
inconsistent, license information is often not machine readable and, from
time to time, repositories leak information that is not open access, we
cannot take any responsibility for the licences of the individual content in
the dataset. It is therefore up to the user of this dataset to ensure that
the way in which they use the dataset does not breach copyright of any third
party. The dataset is in no way intended for the purposes of reading the
original publications, but for machine processing only.

Additionally, while CORE retains no copyright in any of the works in the
database, we reserve the sui generis database rights. This is due to the
substantial investment in obtaining, processing and serving the aggregated
data to the relevant communities of interest.
