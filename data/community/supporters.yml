    While support for open access and open research is growing rapidly, the future of open scholarly infrastructure services, including CORE, is by no means secured. As the number of CORE users has been fast growing, reaching millions of monthly active users and being among the most used open infrastructures globally, so have costs.

    To sustain CORE as a mission-aligned widely used open scholarly infrastructure, we need both the support and advice of the community of open repositories and journals.

    Join our Board of Supporters and help shape our future!
