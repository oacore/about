        Transparency

        Inclusivity
      content: To ensure all are included. Research is not confined to a specific discipline, geography, institution, or stakeholder. Infrastructure must be able to accommodate the diverse needs and perspectives of researchers across the entire research enterprise.

  description: |
    At CORE, we believe that **openness** is fundamental to the philosophy of science, as it promotes transparency, collaboration, and the free exchange of ideas and knowledge. Open science infrastructure facilitates the sharing of research data, software, and publications, making research more **accessible** and **reproducible**, which in turn fosters innovation, accelerates scientific discovery, and maximises the impact of research.
    The Board of Supporters plays a crucial role in **promoting trust** and **accountability** in the research community by **advocating for open and transparent practices** and by shaping the future direction of CORE according to the community’s needs.
