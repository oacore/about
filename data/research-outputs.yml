      The last 10 years have seen a massive increase in the amount of
      Open Access publications in journals and institutional repositories.
      The open availability of large volumes of state-of-the-art knowledge
      online has the potential to provide huge savings and benefits in many
      fields. However, in order to fully leverage this knowledge, it is
      necessary to develop systems that (a) make it easy for users to discover
      and access this knowledge at the level of individual resources,
      (b) explore and analyse this knowledge at the level of collections of
      resources and (c) provide infrastructure and access to raw data in order
      to lower the barriers to the research and development of systems and
      services on top of this knowledge. In this paper, we argue why these
      requirements should be satisfied and show that current systems do not
      meet them. Consequently, we present the CORE (COnnecting REpositories)
      system, a large-scale Open Access aggregation, outlining its existing
      functionality and discussing the future technical development.
      We demonstrate how the system addresses the above needs and how it can
      be applied to the benefit of the whole ecosystem that includes
      institutional repositories, individuals, researchers, developers,
      funding bodies and governments

      Sets the vision for creating the CORE service, developing global-wide
      content aggregation of all open access research literature (on top of
      OAI-PMH protocol for metadata harvesting and other protocols).
      It sets the mission to develop the three access levels (access at the
      granularity of papers; analytical access; access to raw data) via CORE.

      From open access metadata to open access content:
      two principles for increased visibility of open access content

    abstract: |
      An essential goal of the open access (OA) movement is free availability
      of research outputs on the Internet. One of the recommended ways to
      achieve this is through open access repositories (BOAI, 2002).
      Given the growing number of repositories and the significant proportion
      of research outputs already available as OA (Laakso \& Bjork, 2012),
      it might come as a surprise that OA content is not necessarily easily
      discoverable on the Internet (Morrisson, 2012; Konkiel, 2012),
      more precisely, it is available, but often difficult to find. If OA
      content in repositories cannot be discovered, there is little incentive
      to make it available on the Internet in the first place. Therefore, not
      trying hard enough to increase the visibility of OA content would be
      a lost opportunity for achieving the main OA goals, including also the
      reuse potential of OA content. In this paper, we build on our experience
      in finding and aggregating open access content (not just metadata) from
      repositories, discussing the main issues and summarizing the lessons
      learned into two principles that, if adopted, will dramatically increase
      the discoverability of OA content on the Internet and will improve the
      possibilities of OA content reuse.

      This paper describes the two principles that should be followed
      to ensure that content can be properly harvested from repositories.
      This paper could be of great interest to repository managers.

      CORE: aggregation use cases for open access

    abstract: |
      The push for free online availability of research outputs promoted
      by the Open Access (OA) movement is undoubtedly transforming the
      publishing industry. However, the mere availability of research
      outputs is insufficient. To exploit the full potential of OA,
      it must be possible to search, discover, mine, analyse, etc.
      this content. To achieve this, it is essential to improve the existing
      OA technical infrastructure to effectively support these
      functionalities. Many of the vital benefits of OA are expected to come
      with the ability to reuse OA content in unanticipated ways. Access to
      the OA content must therefore be flexible, yet practical, content-based
      and not just metadata based. In this demonstration, we present the
      CORE system, which aggregates millions of OA resources from hundreds
      of OA repositories and journals. We discuss the use cases
      aggregationsshould support and demonstrate how the CORE system addresses
      them, including searching, discovering, mining and analyzing content.
      We also show how aggregated OA content can be reused to build new
      applications on top of CORE?sfunctionality

      Aggregating Research Papers from Publishers? Systems to Support Text
      and Data Mining: Deliberate Lack of Interoperability or Not?

    abstract: |
      In the current technology dominated world, interoperability
      of systems managed by different organisations is an essential property
      enabling the provision of services at a global scale.
      In the Text and Data Mining field (TDM), interoperability of
      systems offering access to text corpora offers the opportunity of
      increasing the uptake and impact of TDM applications. The global corpus
      of all research papers, i.e. the collection of human knowledge so large
      no one can ever read in their lifetime, represents one of the most
      exciting opportunities for TDM. Although the Open Access movement,
      which has been advocating for free availability and reuse rights to
      TDM from research papers, has achieved some major successes on the
      legal front, the technical interoperability of systems offering free
      access to research papers continues to be a challenge.
      COnnecting REpositories (CORE) (Knoth and Zdrahal, 2012) aggregates
      the world?s open access full-text scientific manuscripts from
      repositories, journals and publisher  systems. One of the main goals of
      CORE is to harmonise and pre-process these data to lower the barrier for
      TDM. In this paper, we report on the preliminary results of
      an interoperability survey of systems provided by journal publishers,
      both open access and toll access. This helps us to assess the current
      level of systems? interoperability and suggest ways forward
    description: |
      This paper describes the technical challenges relating to machine
      interfaces, the interoperability issues on obtaining open access
      content and the complications of achieving a harmonisation across
      repositories’ and publishers’ systems.

      This submission reports on the results of the ongoing JISC-funded
      project CORE (COnnecting REpositories) which aims to facilitate
      the access and navigation across relevant scientific papers stored
      in Open Access repositories. This is being achieved by harvesting
      metadata and full-text content from diverse Open Access repositories,
      applying text mining techniques to discover semantic relations between
      the articles and representing and exposing these relations
      as Linked Data. The information about associations between articles
      will be made publicly available to enable the emergence of a wide range
      of applications that can exploit the provided data. Within this project,
      we will demonstrate the usability of the CORE system on two use-cases:
      (1) Improving the accessibility of content and the navigation

      In this paper, we argue why and how the integration of recommender
      systems for research can enhance the functionality and user experience
      in repositories. We present the latest technical innovations in the
      CORE Recommender, which provides research article recommendations across
      the global network of repositories and journals. The CORE Recommender
      has been recently redeveloped and released into production in the CORE
      system and has also been deployed in several third-party repositories.
      We explain the design choices of this unique system and the evaluation
      processes we have in place to continue raising the quality of
      the provided recommendations. By drawing on our experience, we discuss
      the main challenges in offering a state-of-the-art recommender solution
      for repositories. We highlight two of the key limitations of
      the current repository infrastructure with respect to developing
      research recommender systems: 1) the lack of a standardised protocol
      and capabilities for exposing anonymised user-interaction logs, which
      represent critically important input data for recommender systems based
      on collaborative filtering and 2) the lack of a voluntary global
      sign-on capability in repositories, which would enable the creation of
      personalised recommendation and notification solutions based on past
      user interactions

            abstract = {In this paper, we argue why and how the integration of recommender systems for research can enhance the functionality and user experience in repositories. We present the latest technical innovations in the CORE Recommender, which provides research article recommendations across the global network of repositories and journals. The CORE Recommender has been recently redeveloped and released into production in the CORE system and has also been deployed in several third-party repositories. We explain the design choices of this unique system and the evaluation processes we have in place to continue raising the quality of the provided recommendations. By drawing on our experience, we discuss the main challenges in offering a state-of-the-art recommender solution for repositories. We highlight two of the key limitations of the current repository infrastructure with respect to developing research recommender systems: 1) the lack of a standardised protocol and capabilities for exposing anonymised user-interaction logs, which represent critically important input data for recommender systems based on collaborative filtering and 2) the lack of a voluntary global sign-on capability in repositories, which would enable the creation of personalised recommendation and notification solutions based on past user interactions.}

      This paper investigates the use and the prediction potential of
      semantic similarity measures for automatic generation of links across
      different documents and passages. First, the correlation between the way
      people link content and the results produced by standard semantic
      similarity measures is investigated. The relation between semantic
      similarity and the length of the documents is then also analysed.
      Based on these findings a new method for link generation is formulated
      and tested

      Developing Infrastructure to Support Closer Collaboration

    abstract: |
      The amount of open access content stored in repositories has increased
      dramatically, which has created new technical and organisational
      challenges for bringing this content together.
      The COnnecting REpositories (CORE) project has been dealing with these
      challenges by aggregating and enriching content from hundreds of open
      access repositories, increasing the discoverability and reusability of
      millions of open access manuscripts. As repository managers and library
      directors often wish to know the details of the content harvested from
      their repositories and keep a certain level of control over it, CORE is
      now facing the challenge of how to enable content providers to manage
      their content in the aggregation and control the harvesting process.
      In order to improve the quality and transparency of the aggregation
      process and create a two-way collaboration between the CORE project and
      the content providers, we propose the CORE Dashboard

      This paper presents the CORE Repositories Dashboard, a tool designed
      primarily for repository managers. It describes how the Dashboard
      improves the quality of the harvested papers, advances the collaboration
      between the repository managers and CORE, enables a straightforward
      management of their collections and enhances the transparency of
      the harvested content.

      My repository is being aggregated: a blessing or a curse?

    abstract: |
      Usage statistics are frequently used by repositories to justify their
      value to the management who decide about the funding to support the
      repository infrastructure. Another reason for collecting usage statistics
      at repositories is the increased use of webometrics in the process of
      assessing the impact of publications and researchers.
      Consequently, one of the worries repositories sometimes have about their
      content being aggregated is that they feel aggregations have a detrimental
      effect on the accuracy of statistics they collect. They believe that this
      potential decrease in reported usage can negatively influence the funding
      provided by their own institutions. This raises the fundamental question
      of whether repositories should allow aggregators to harvest their metadata
      and content. In this paper, we discuss the benefits of allowing content
      aggregations harvest repository content and investigate how to overcome
      the drawbacks
