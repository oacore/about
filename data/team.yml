    I recently completed my MSc in Computer Science at The University of
    Hertfordshire. I joined the team at KMi as a PhD research student
    with Dr. Petr Knoth and Professor Zdenek Zdrahal as my supervisors.
    My thesis will expand on the original work on Semantometrics completed
    by Dr Knoth and Dasha Herrmannova. My areas of interest include semantics,
    natural language processing and text mining.
