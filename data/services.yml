      CORE harvests, maintains, enriches and makes available metadata and full text
      content - typically a PDF - from many Open Access journals and repositories.
      This makes it a useful access point for those who would like to develop applications
      making use of this content. To support these activities, CORE is providing a free API.

    short-description: Download data in bulk
    description: |
      The data aggregated from repositories by CORE can be accessed
      in two ways, through the CORE API or by downloading the data to
      your computer. The former option is practical if you want to build
      a service on top of CORE while the latter is something we recommend
      to those who would like to analyse the CORE dataset and/or apply
      some computationally intensive batch processes.

      In an effort to improve the quality and transparency of the harvesting process
      of the open access content and create a two way collaboration between the CORE
      project and the providers of this content, CORE has implemented the Repositories
      Dashboard. The aim of the Dashboard is to provide an online interface for
      repository providers and offer valuable information to content providers.
