    description: CORE harvests, maintains, enriches and makes available metadata and full-text content (typically a PDF) 
    from many Open Access journals and repositories. This makes it a useful access point for those who would like to develop 
    applications making use of this content. To support these activities, CORE is providing a free API.

    title: Datasets
    description: The data aggregated from repositories by the CORE system can be accessed in two ways, 
    through the CORE API or by downloading the data to your computer. The former option is practical if you want to build 
    a service on top of CORE while the latter is something we recommend to those who would like to analyse the CORE dataset 
    and/or apply some computationally intensive batch processes.
