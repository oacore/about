    description: |
      CORE harvests, maintains, enriches and makes available metadata and
      full-text content (typically a PDF) from many Open Access journals and
      repositories. This makes it a useful access point for those who would
      like to develop applications making use of this content. To support these
      activities, CORE is providing a free API.

    title: Dataset
    description: |
      The data aggregated from repositories by the CORE system can be accessed
      in two ways, through the CORE API or by downloading the data to your
      computer. The former option is practical if you want to build a service
      on top of CORE while the latter is something we recommend to those who
      would like to analyse the CORE dataset and/or apply some computationally
      intensive batch processes.

      In an effort to improve the quality and transparency of the harvesting
      process of the open access content and create a two way collaboration

      introduced the Repositories Dashboard.
